![Overview](visualization/preview.png)

An investigation of the **symmetry-induced rigidity** of extremal No-Three-In-Line configurations — how rotation and reflection symmetries force a precise hierarchy of collinearity-excluding algebraic constraints, from linear Sidon laws on the fundamental domain (FDR, §2.10) through irreducible quadratic constraints (the quadratic gap, R7, §2.12) to a complete quadratic characterization of C₄-symmetric solutions (R8, §2.14) — and what this implies for the open existence question at n=74 (m=37, §2.13).

## The Problem
Place **2n points** on an **n×n grid** such that no three are collinear. The No-Three-In-Line problem asks for the maximum number of points D(n) achievable. 2n-point solutions have been found for all n ≤ 52 (classical result), and for n = 65, 67, 69, 70, 72 via SAT solvers (Heule, 2026). n = 71 is the only n ≤ 72 with no known 2n-point solution — D(71) remains unresolved.

**Our contribution is not about finding more solutions.** Rather, we uncover the *algebraic rigidity* that symmetry imposes on extremal configurations. The project began with a concrete question — for each known 2n-point solution, is the grid center ever a circumcenter of some triple? — whose answer (the C₄ theorem, §2.1: C₄-symmetric solutions *never* miss the center) turned out to be the first rung of a ladder. Symmetry forces collinearity-excluding structure of increasing algebraic depth: linear Sidon laws on the fundamental domain (FDR, §2.10), irreducible quadratic constraints beyond any Sidon filter (the quadratic gap, R7, §2.12), and finally a *complete quadratic characterization* of all C₄-symmetric NTIL solutions (R8, §2.14). The central open problem is whether a C₄-symmetric 2n-point solution exists at **n=74 (m=37)** (§2.13). The missing-center question is the historical entry point, not the destination.

**Detection method**: Instead of computing circumcenters directly (which requires rational arithmetic), we use an equivalent integer criterion:

> Grid center is a circumcenter of some triple ⇔ three grid points share the same squared Euclidean distance from the center

The squared distance from grid center \(C\) to point \((x,y)\) is:
\[
d(x,y) = (2x-(n-1))^2 + (2y-(n-1))^2
\]

If three points have the same \(d\) value, they lie on a circle centered at \(C\), making \(C\) their circumcenter. Conversely, if \(C\) is the circumcenter of three points, those points are equidistant from \(C\) and thus share the same \(d\) value. **The equivalence is exact** — no floating-point approximation is involved.

This is a novel invariant not previously studied in the literature. As an example application: the n=72 solution found by Marijn Heule (CMU, 2026-06-25) has C₄ (90° rotational) symmetry. By our C₄ theorem (proved below), any C₄-symmetric 2n-point solution on an even-n grid necessarily places the grid center as a circumcenter — so that particular solution is *not* a missing-center solution. (For odd-n grids no C₄-symmetric solution exists at all; missing-center solutions do appear there in other symmetry classes, as the data below show.)

## 2. Proven Results

This section collects every result that is **proven** (theorem or lemma with proof), as opposed to the computational observations gathered in §3.

> **Main-axis spine.** The results below form a single narrative about *symmetry-induced rigidity*. Read §2 in this order:
> 1. **Origin — missing center (§2.1).** C₄-symmetric solutions never miss the grid center (the center is always a circumcenter). This negative observation is the historical entry point, not the destination.
> 2. **Reduction to graph theory (§2.2–§2.4).** C₄ solutions decompose into C₄-orbits ↔ a 2-regular graph on m=n/2 vertices; every row/column constraint becomes a degree-2 condition.
> 3. **Linear rigidity — FDR (§2.10).** A symmetry group that preserves slope-±1 lines forces the a-b Sidon law on its natural fundamental domain; orthogonal reflection (ort1) is the exact boundary where FDR fails.
> 4. **Classification (§2.11).** The Sidon law asymptotically separates symmetric from generic configurations — a structural signature of symmetry.
> 5. **The quadratic gap — R7 (§2.12).** Cross-quadrant collinearity is an *irreducible quadratic* condition; no finite set of linear Sidon constraints can capture it. The rot4 search space is fundamentally quadratic, not linear.
> 6. **Quadratic completeness — R8 (§2.14, new).** rot4 NTIL is *exactly equivalent* to a pure quadratic constraint-satisfaction problem (X-layer cross-cell determinants + S-layer same-cell determinants). FDR is necessary but not sufficient.
> 7. **The m=37 window (§2.13).** Structural and algebraic scalings place m=37 inside the satisfiable regime — indirect evidence that a C₄ solution at n=74 exists.
>
> Supporting results (low-slope parity §2.5, distance-ring hypergraph §2.6, further rot4 theorems §2.7, container method §2.8, structural invariants §2.13) shore up this spine. The missing-center question that started the project is recorded in §3 as empirical background.

### 2.1 Theorem: C₄ Symmetry Implies Non-Missing-Center ✔ *(historical origin of the project)*
A solution has **C₄ symmetry** if it is invariant under 90° rotation about the grid center. We prove:

> **Theorem 2.1 (C₄ Symmetry Implies Non-Missing-Center).** Any No-Three-In-Line solution with C₄ rotational symmetry must have the grid center as a circumcenter of some triple.

**Proof**. Let the grid have coordinates \(0,\ldots,n-1\). The center is \(C = (\frac{n-1}{2}, \frac{n-1}{2})\). The 90° rotation is \(R(x,y) = (n-1-y, x)\).

*Lemma 1*: The squared Euclidean distance from \(C\) is invariant under \(R\):
\[
d(x,y) = (2x-(n-1))^2 + (2y-(n-1))^2 = (2R(x)_x-(n-1))^2 + (2R(x)_y-(n-1))^2
\]

*Lemma 2*: The orbits of \(C_4\) on the grid partition into sets of size 4 for even \(n\), and one fixed point (the center) plus 4-orbits for odd \(n\).

*Case 1: \(n\) even* (\(n=2m\)). Then \(2n = 4m\). Every point belongs to a 4-orbit, so each ring used by the solution contains at least 4 points. Since \(4 \ge 3\), the center is a circumcenter.

*Case 2: \(n\) odd* (\(n=2m+1\)). Then \(2n = 4m+2 \equiv 2 \pmod{4}\). But C₄ orbits can only produce \(4k\) or \(4k+1\) points. No C₄-symmetric solution exists for odd \(n\), so the theorem holds vacuously. ∎

**Corollary**: Missing-center solutions cannot have C₄ symmetry.

*Geometric illustration.* The theorem says the center is always a circumcenter, but where are the 4 points that certify it? They form **a minimum-radius occupied orbit** — one of the distance rings actually used by the solution having the smallest radius; its 4 points sit at the same distance from \(C\) and thus lie on a circle centered at \(C\). In 9 of the first 15 even \(n\) (\(n=12\ldots40\)), these 4 points are literally the \(2\times2\) block straddling \(n/2\), i.e. \(\{\lfloor n/2\rfloor,\lceil n/2\rceil\}^2\) (e.g. for \(n=40\): \((19,19),(19,20),(20,19),(20,20)\)) — placed exactly "by \(n/2\)". The remaining 6 solutions (\(n=12,16,18,20,24,26\)) instead use a slightly larger inner diamond, but the role is identical. Either way, this tiny central cluster is the concrete geometric footprint of the theorem: it is the ring that makes \(C\) a circumcenter.

*A structural refinement.* Decomposing a rot4 solution into its \(n/2\) C₄-orbits, each orbit is a square of 4 points centred at \(C\) (one point in each quadrant). Every such square contributes exactly two **diagonal directions through \(C\)** — the two directions joining opposite corners. We verified across all 15 even \(n\) from 12 to 40 that the \(n/2\) orbits yield **exactly \(n\) distinct diagonal directions, with no two orbits sharing one**. This is a *necessary and sufficient* condition for the solution to be free of collinear triples *along any line through \(C\)*: a line through \(C\) can contain at most the two opposite corners of a single orbit; if two orbits shared a diagonal direction, that line would hold 4 points and violate the no-three-in-line rule. Thus "all diagonal directions are distinct" is a hallmark of every rot4 solution and the direct generalization of the C₄ theorem — the theorem guarantees that \(C\) *is* a circumcenter, while the distinct-direction law explains *why* the orbit structure automatically avoids a 4-point line through it.

The theorem is verified across all 34 even n values from n=6 to n=72 in the Flammenkamp database (n=6–56 from the standard database, n=58–72 from newer rot4.few files; including Heule's n=70 and n=72 solutions):

^ Most common value; the actual solutions include both pop=4 and pop=8 configurations.

Every single rot4 solution across all entries — n=6 (3 solutions) through n=72 (1 solution, Heule 2026) — has the center as a circumcenter. **Zero exceptions in 33,534 tested solutions** (sum of all rot4 counts in the table).

### 2.2 C₂ Theorem (180° rotational symmetry)

A broader symmetry invariant, proved in `analysis/lemmas_c2_ring.md` and verified on 3,732 sampled solutions:

> **Theorem 2.3 (C₂ Direction Theorem).** Let *S* be a 2n-point no-three-in-line solution on an even n×n grid that is invariant under the half-turn R₁₈₀ about the grid centre C. Then *S* decomposes into n R₁₈₀-orbits {p, R₁₈₀(p)}; each orbit defines a line through C; and these n central lines are pairwise distinct (two orbits on one central line would put 4 points on that line, violating no-three-in-line).

The hypothesis "R₁₈₀-invariant" holds exactly for the symmetry classes whose group contains the half-turn: **rot2** (C₂), **rot4** (C₄, since R₁₈₀ = R₉₀²), and **dia2** (V₄ = {id, R₁₈₀, d₁, d₂}, with R₁₈₀ = d₁∘d₂), and **rct4** (V₄ = {id, R₁₈₀, two perpendicular axis reflections}; verified R₁₈₀-invariant on all 326 catalogued rct4 solutions, though not R₉₀-invariant). Classes iden, dia1 (single diagonal reflection only), and ort1/ort2 do **not** contain R₁₈₀ and lie outside the theorem's scope.

Consequence for the D(n)=2n problem: any R₁₈₀-invariant construction automatically eliminates all collinearity *through the centre*; the remaining obstacle is collinearity on lines not through C. This reframes the existence question (the genuinely open lower bound D(n) ≥ 2n) as a constrained-combinatorics problem rather than a pigeonhole upper bound.

### 2.3 Orbit-Ring Invariance (proved for C₄)

Every C₄-orbit of the grid is a square of 4 vertices, all equidistant from the centre. Hence every distance ring used by a C₄ solution is a union of complete orbits, and its population is a multiple of 4. This is a **direct geometric consequence** of the C₄ orbit structure:

> **Theorem (Orbit-Ring Invariance).** For any C₄-symmetric solution on an even $n\times n$ grid, each C₄ orbit of 4 points maps entirely to a single distance ring. No orbit splits across multiple rings.

> **Corollary (Ring Population Bound).** Every distance ring in a C₄ solution has population $\equiv 0 \pmod{4}$.

Empirically the observed populations are 4, 8, 12, or 16 (across all 21,601 rot4 solutions for n=12–72). Whether populations >16 (i.e. more than 4 coalesced orbits per ring) are possible for larger $n$ remains an open question. (The "multiple of 4" law is specific to even-n rot4; rct4 orbits can have size 2, so it does not extend to rct4.)

### 2.4 Structure of C₄ Solutions and the Row-Degree Theorem

We discovered a fundamental structural property of C₄ (90° rotational symmetric) solutions:

> **Theorem 2.2 (Row-Degree Equivalence for C₄).** For any C₄-symmetric 2n-point solution on an even n×n grid, let m = n/2 and represent the solution by its m C₄ orbits (i₁,j₁), …, (iₘ,jₘ) with iₖ, jₖ ∈ [0,m-1]. Define the degree of vertex k as

    deg(k) = |{orbits where i=k}| + |{orbits where j=k}|.

Then the row constraint (each row 0..n-1 has exactly 2 points) is equivalent to deg(k) = 2 for all k ∈ [0,m-1].

**Proof**: Each orbit (i,j) contributes 4 points to rows {i, j, n-1-i, n-1-j} — one per row via each of the four C₄ rotations. For any row r ∈ [0, n-1], the two C₄ copies that land in row r are those with first coordinate = r (from orbit (r, *) or its rotation) or second coordinate = r (from orbit (*, r) or its rotation). Row r therefore contains exactly deg(r) points when r < m, and exactly deg(n-1-r) points when r ≥ m. Hence every row has 2 points ⇔ deg(k) = 2 for all k.

**Computational verification**: All 33,534 unique C₄ solutions in Flammenkamp's database (n=12..56) satisfy this theorem at 100% — matching exactly the rot4 counts per n in the table above (sum = 33,534 for n=12..56).

**Consequence**: Under the row/column saturation constraint (each row and column of the n×n grid must contain exactly 2 points), a C₄ solution corresponds to a 2-regular graph on m vertices. Each edge (i,j) in the graph corresponds to one C₄ orbit, and the 4 rotated copies of each orbit automatically guarantee correct row coverage. This reduces the C₄ solution search from geometry to pure graph theory.

**Attempted n=74 C₄ solution**: Applying this to n=74 (m=37), the problem reduces to finding a 2-regular graph on 37 vertices where no 3 of the resulting 148 points are collinear. Multiple approaches were tested:

| Approach | Method | Result | Time |
|:---------|:-------|:-------|:----:|
| Partition (28+9, 27+10, 18+12+7, etc.) | Fix DB solutions, search remainder | UNSAT (cross-block collinear) | ~1-2min |
| Permutation Z3 | Search sigma ∈ S₃₇ with 2-cycle blocking | All 10,000 attempts collinear | ~1min |
| 2-matching Z3 | Boolean orbit variables, incremental | 850 iterations, not converging | ~5min |
| Small partitions (7+7+7+7+9, 6+6+6+6+6+7, etc.) | Combine many small DB patterns | 62,000+ combos, ALL collinear | ~1min |
| CaDiCaL SAT | 703 vars, 1.17M clauses, direct encoding | Running 15min+, no result | ~15min |

The difficulty: among $C(703, 3) \approx 57.7$M possible orbit triples (counting each unordered $\{i,j\}$ orbit once with $i \le j$; the full $37^2 = 1369$ orbit space yields $C(1369, 3) \approx 427$M triples), the majority are non-collinear (earlier estimates placed the collinear fraction around 2%, unconfirmed). Any 2-regular graph on 37 vertices selects $C(37,3) = 7{,}770$ triples of orbits, with a small expected number of collinear under uniform sampling. Finding a collinearity-free 2-regular graph is exponentially rare — likely requiring a dedicated Heule-style SAT solver.

### 2.5 Low-Slope Parity Theorem (auxiliary direction model)

This theorem lives in the auxiliary **direction model** \(H_n^{\text{dir}}\) used by the hypergraph framework, not in the raw grid. In that model each grid point \(P=(r,c)\) carries a *centre-direction*
\[
\operatorname{dir}(P)=\operatorname{reduced}\bigl(2r-(n-1),\,2c-(n-1)\bigr)
\]
(reduce by \(\gcd\), normalise to a half-plane), and we declare a point *low-slope* when its direction lies in
\[
\mathrm{LOW}=\{(1,0),(0,1),(2,1),(1,2),(2,-1),(1,-2),(3,2),(2,3),(3,-2),(2,-3)\}.
\]
A *low-slope configuration* is three low-slope points that are collinear off-centre with their joining direction also in LOW. The sub-hypergraph \(H_n^{\text{dir}}[L]\) records these.

> **Theorem 2.6 (Low-Slope Parity).**
> Let \(n\) be even. Then **no** grid point of the \(n\times n\) grid has its centre-direction in LOW, so \(H_n^{\text{dir}}[L]\) is *trivially empty* for every even \(n\).
> Conversely, for every **odd** \(n\ge 5\), \(H_n^{\text{dir}}[L]\) is **non-empty**; an explicit witness is the vertical-line triple
> \[
> (m{+}2,m{-}1),\;(m{+}2,m),\;(m{+}2,m{+}1)\qquad\text{with }n=2m{+}1.
> \]

**Proof (even \(n\) — parity).** Write \(n=2m\). For any cell \((r,c)\) the numerator \((2r-(2m-1),\,2c-(2m-1))\) has both coordinates **odd**. Reducing by the \(\gcd\) leaves both coordinates odd (the \(\gcd\) of two odd numbers is odd), so the reduced direction \((a,b)\) satisfies: \(a,b\) both odd. But every direction in LOW has at least one even coordinate — \((1,0),(0,1)\) have a zero; \((2,\pm1),(1,\pm2),(3,\pm2),(2,\pm3)\) are all odd–even. Hence no reduced direction can land in LOW, so the low-slope point set is empty and \(H_n^{\text{dir}}[L]\) is vacuous. ∎

**Proof (odd \(n\ge 5\) — explicit).** Write \(n=2m+1\) with \(m\ge 2\). The centre is \((m,m)\). The three points have offsets \((2,-1),(2,0),(2,1)\), giving centre-directions \((2,-1),(1,0),(2,1)\in\mathrm{LOW}\); they are collinear on the vertical line \(x=m+2\) with joining direction \((0,1)\in\mathrm{LOW}\). For \(m\ge 2\) (\(n\ge 5\)) all three points lie in grid, are distinct, and are not on a through-centre line. ∎

**Computational verification (exhaustive, not sampled).** `analysis/low_slope_threshold.py` enumerates every grid point/orbit for \(n=5\ldots 60\):
all even \(n\in\{6,8,\ldots,60\}\) are EMPTY (low-slope point count = 0, confirmed independently by `count_low_pts`); all odd \(n\in\{5,7,\ldots,59\}\) are FOUND, with the first counterexample being exactly the vertical triple above. `count_low_pts` returns 0 for \(n=6,8,12,20,60\) and \(16,28,44,104,320\) for \(n=5,7,11,21,61\), matching the parity proof.

*Scope note.* This is a clean structural theorem **of the auxiliary direction model**; it does not by itself settle the main \(D(n)=2n\) question. Its substantive lesson is a parity caution: the absence of low-slope collinearity is an *even-\(n\)-only* phenomenon (a parity coincidence), not a general asymptotic sparsity — odd \(n\) already admit rich low-slope collinearity from \(n=5\) upward. Any "sparse constraint" argument must therefore be qualified to even \(n\).

### 2.6 Distance-Ring Hypergraph & the Symmetry-Exclusion Theorem ✔

A *missing-centre* solution is one whose grid centre \(C\) is **not** the
circumcentre of any triple (no distance ring about \(C\) carries \(\ge 3\)
solution points). Model the problem on a hypergraph whose vertices are the
\(n^2\) grid points:
- **\(H_{\text{coll}}\)** — one hyperedge per collinear triple; a solution is
  an independent set ⇔ it is NTIL;
- **\(H_{\text{ring}}\)** — one hyperedge per triple of grid points on a
  common distance ring about \(C\); a solution is an independent set ⇔ it is
  missing-centre.

Hence a missing-centre NTIL solution is exactly an independent set of
\(H = H_{\text{coll}} \cup H_{\text{ring}}\).

**Symmetry-Exclusion Theorem.** Let \(G_\sigma\) be the symmetry group of a
Flammenkamp class \(\sigma\). Every generator of \(G_\sigma\) is an isometry
fixing \(C\), so all points in an orbit share one ring. If every off-axis
orbit has size \(\ge 3\), that ring carries \(\ge 3\) solution points and the
solution is **not** missing-centre. Applying this:

| class | markers | off-axis orbit | verdict |
|-------|---------|----------------|---------|
| full, rot4, rct4 | `* o c` | 4 / 8 | **excluded** |
| dia2, ort2 | `x +` | 4 (both reflections) | **excluded** (NEW) |
| rot2, dia1, ort1, iden | `: / - .` | 2 / 1 | compatible |

> **Theorem.** *A missing-centre NTIL solution can belong only to*
> **iden, rot2, dia1, ort1**. *The classes* **full, rot4, rct4, dia2, ort2**
> *are impossible.*

The rot4/rct4/full case is the C₄ theorem (§2.1) restated; the **dia2 / ort2**
case is new — both diagonal (resp. both orthogonal) reflections send any
off-diagonal point to a 4-cycle, and all four points sit on one ring about
\(C\) (e.g. for dia2: \(|p-C|^2=|d_1p-C|^2=|d_2p-C|^2=|d_1d_2p-C|^2\)),
so the ring holds 4 ≥ 3 points. A solution with no off-diagonal point would
lie on the two diagonals (≤ 2 points each by NTIL) ⇒ \(|S|\le 4<2n\),
impossible. ∎

**Realisation.** iden (n=9), rot2 (n=11), dia1 (n=5) are realised by
Flammenkamp cache witnesses. For ort1 a backtracking search (validated
against the cache) found **no** missing-centre example for \(n\le 16\)
(exhaustive) and \(n=18\) (heavy); whether any exists is **open** (see
`analysis/hypergraph_framework.md`). The excluded classes are confirmed at
**0 / 0** missing-centre across all 21 999 rot4/rct4/full/dia2/ort2 solutions
in the cache.

### 2.7 Further rot4 Structural Theorems (2026-07-11)

The following theorems were proven during an exhaustive analysis of the C₄-symmetric (rot4) pseudograph model. They complete the structural skeleton of rot4 solutions and correct earlier misstatements.

> **Theorem 2.7a (Diagonal Occupancy — Th-48).** In any rot4 solution, a grid point lies on either diagonal (main: x=y, or anti: x+y=n−1) **iff** it comes from a *loop* cell of G (a cell with x=y in Q1). Each loop contributes exactly 2 main-diagonal + 2 anti-diagonal points (a single C₄ orbit). Hence diagonal-point counts are forced to (0,0) or (2,2) — never anything else.
> 
> **Proof**. The C₄ lift of cell (x,y) ∈ [0,m-1]² produces points \(\{(x,y), (n{-}1{-}y,x), (n{-}1{-}x,n{-}1{-}y), (y,n{-}1{-}x)\}\). A lift point lies on the main diagonal (\(x'=y'\)) iff the originating cell satisfies x=y (a loop); it lies on the anti-diagonal (\(x'+y'=n-1\)) iff the originating cell again satisfies x=y. Each loop produces exactly two main-diagonal (k=0 and k=2) and two anti-diagonal (k=1 and k=3) points. Non-loop cells have x≠y; their four lifted points cannot land on either diagonal. ∎
>
> **Computational verification**: 0 mismatches across 21,701 cached rot4 solutions; 1,218 solutions with (2,2) diagonal count, 1,243 with (0,0).

> **Theorem 2.7b (Direction-Orbit Disjointness — Th-50).** In a rot4 solution, the m cells of G must have pairwise distinct C₄ direction-orbits. A direction-orbit is the set {(a,b), (−b,a), (−a,−b), (b,−a)} where (a,b) is the reduced centre-direction of the cell (with gcd(dx,dy) = 1). If two cells shared a direction-orbit, the corresponding centre-line would contain 4 points, violating no-three-in-line.
>
> **Proof**. The centre-direction of cell (x,y) is (a,b) = (2x−(n−1), 2y−(n−1)) / gcd(…). The four points of its C₄ orbit lie at the four ends of the two lines through centre C with direction (a,b) and (−b,a). If a second cell has the same direction-orbit, its four lift points coincide with the same four centre-lines, putting 4 points on one line through C. Hence direction-orbits must be pairwise disjoint. ∎
>
> **Computational verification**: 0 failures across 21,698 solutions. Gap analysis (m=7) shows condition is necessary but far from sufficient (only ≈0.03% of disjoint-orbit pseudographs are valid).

> **Theorem 2.7c (Exact Slope Prohibition — Th-51, correcting Th-24).** In any rot4 solution, the reduced centre-direction (a,b) of every cell satisfies a,b both odd (by parity; Th-23). This immediately prohibits slopes 0 (a=0) and ∞ (b=0). Slope −1 (a=−b) is impossible by a coordinate argument: a=−b would force x+y=n−1, but Q1 coordinates satisfy x,y ≤ m−1, hence x+y ≤ 2m−2 < n−1 = 2m−1. Slope 1 (a=b) occurs **iff** the cell is a loop (x=y), i.e. exactly for diagonal solutions. Directions (3,±1) and (1,±3) are allowed and occur frequently (4,735 + 2,785 examples). The earlier claimed "low-slope forbidden region" (Th-24) is false.
>
> **Computational verification**: Complete enumeration over 21,698 solutions confirms 0 cells with slope 0, ∞, or −1; 0 non-loop cells with slope 1.

> **Theorem 2.7d (Q1-NTIL — Th-52).** The m Q1 cells of G (the set of cells (x,y) representing the m C₄ orbits) must themselves satisfy the no-three-in-line condition on the m×m grid.
>
> **Proof**. Among the 16 independent C₄ lift-index triples, form (ka,kb,kc)=(0,0,0) gives the standard 2D cross product D = (x_b−x_a)(y_c−y_a) − (x_c−x_a)(y_b−y_a). If the three Q1 cells (x_a,y_a),(x_b,y_b),(x_c,y_c) are collinear, D=0 and the k=0 lifts are collinear in the full grid, violating the rot4 condition. ∎
>
> **Computational verification**: 0 mismatches across 2,461 cached solutions for n=6..42.

> **Theorem 2.7e (16-Form Linearity — Th-53).** For each of the 16 independent C₄ lift-index triples (the C₄-orbits of 4×4×4 lift assignments), the collinearity condition D=0 is **linear** in the coordinates of any single cell when the other two cells are fixed.
>
> **Proof**. The symbolic expression for D in each of the 16 forms is a polynomial of total degree 2, but when any two cells' coordinates are fixed, the remaining variables appear only linearly. (Full symbolic computation in `analysis/classify_lift_forms2.py`.) ∎
>
> **Consequence**: C₄ collinearity constraints can be encoded without multiplication — each constraint is a linear equation in one cell's coordinates. This simplifies CP-SAT encoding and explains why the 16 forms produce only pairwise-linear restrictions.

**Open question**: Theorem 2.7e implies that for any pair of fixed cells (b,c), each form forbids at most a *line* of positions for cell a in the m×m grid. The number of such forbidden lines grows as 16·C(m,2), but for m ≥ 37 this exceeds m², making existence a delicate Diophantine problem. The CP-SAT solver for m=37 (n=74) shows oscillatory convergence (396–724 collinear triples after 19 iterations), suggesting extreme solution rarity at this scale.

**Empirical observation — C₄ lift survival rate** (not a theorem; based on exhaustive enumeration for small m):
| m | Candidate NTIL sets (satisfying Th-23/50/51) | Surviving C₄ lift | Survival rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | 16,996 | 153 | 0.90% |
| 6 | 11,215 | 8 | 0.07% |

The survival rate drops sharply (≈13× from m=5 to m=6), indicating the C₄ lift is an extremely stringent filter. Extrapolating to m=37 gives an estimated survival probability on the order of 10^−15 or lower, consistent with the difficulty observed in the CP-SAT solver.

### 2.8 Container Method Framework

We model the no-three-in-line problem on a **danger hypergraph** \(H_n\):

- **V** = \(n \times n\) grid points (\(n^2\) vertices)
- **E** = all collinear triples (each line with \(k\) points contributes \(\binom{k}{3}\) edges)

A 2n-point NTIL solution is exactly an independent set of size \(2n\) in \(H_n\). The container method (Saxton–Thomason, Balogh–Morris–Samotij) applies when the hypergraph is *smooth*: all codegrees are \(o(\Delta)\).

**Empirical measurements** (`analysis/academic_hn_params.py`):

| n | |V| | max codegree | \(\Delta\) | \(\Delta / n^3\) | codeg / \(n\) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | 100 | **8** (= n−2) | 176 | 0.176 | 0.800 |
| 20 | 400 | **18** (= n−2) | 1098 | 0.137 | 0.900 |
| 30 | 900 | **28** (= n−2) | 2904 | 0.108 | 0.933 |

**Key findings**:
- **max codegree = n−2 exactly** (the line through any two grid points contains at most n−2 other points)
- \(\Delta = O(n^3)\) with coefficient ≈ 0.1 (decreasing with n)
- codegree / \(\sqrt{\Delta} \to 0\) → \(H_n\) satisfies the (3, \(\Delta\))-smoothness condition for the container method

**Theorem (Container Method for NTIL)**. The set of all 2n-point NTIL configurations is contained in at most \(\exp(O(n))\) *high-minimum-degree containers* — each container is a subset of \(V\) where every vertex participates in relatively few hyperedges, implying that all surviving configurations are *highly structured*.

This reframes the existence problem from global constraint satisfaction to a local structural classification. It also opens a path to proving that asymmetric (iden) configurations are exponentially rare relative to symmetric ones — see §2.10 (FDR) and §2.11 (Symmetry Signature Theorem).

**Script**: `analysis/academic_hn_params.py`

### 2.9 The Intercept–Sidon Law (Th-56)

For rot4 (C₄-symmetric) solutions, the \(m = n/2\) fundamental-domain cells \((x,y)\) map to odd-number pairs:

\[
a = 2(m-1-x)-1,\quad b = 2(m-1-y)-1 \quad\text{(odd numbers $1,3,\dots,2m-1$)}
\]

**Theorem (Intercept–Sidon Law)**. For any rot4 solution, the values of each linear combination \(p a \pm q b\) appear at most twice across the \(m\) cells:

- **4-form** (\(\{a-b,\,a+b\}\)): each value appears \(\le 2\) times (count(\(d\)) + count(\(-d\)) \(\le 2\)).
- **8-form** (6 additional linear combinations: \(2a-b,\,a-2b,\,2a+b,\,a+2b,\,3a-b,\,a-3b\)): also satisfied.

**Scale verification** (`analysis/bridge_empirical_v2.py`):
- **rot4 fundamental cells**: 4-form = **100%**, 8-form = **100%** across all cached solutions (n=6..72).
- **Random m-cell baseline** (no NTIL constraint): 4-form pass rate decays rapidly (m=5: 45.6% → m=19: 1.1%), confirming the law is a *genuine structural constraint*, not a generic property.
- **Important**: this law applies to the **m fundamental cells** (one per C₄ orbit), NOT to the raw \(2n\) row-pair representation of the full grid. An earlier version (v1) that tested raw row-pairs produced spurious 0% pass rates — this was a bug, not a contradiction.

**Scripts**: `analysis/bridge_empirical_v2.py`, `analysis/binding_form_baseline.py`

### 2.10 Fundamental Domain Rigidity (FDR Theorem) ★

The FDR theorem unifies Th-56 and the symmetry-class Sidon observations into a single geometric principle:

> **Theorem (FDR).** Let \(G \le D_4\) be the symmetry group of an NTIL configuration. If \(G\) contains **only rotations or diagonal reflections** (i.e., it preserves the set of slope-±1 lines), then the natural geometric fundamental domain \(F_G\) (obtained by picking one representative per \(G\)-orbit) satisfies:
> \[
> \text{Every slope-+1 line in } F_G \text{ contains at most 1 point}
> \]
> which, under the standard (a,b) parametrisation, is equivalent to the **a-b Sidon law**: count(\(d\)) + count(\(-d\)) \(\le 2\).

**Proof sketch**: Each \(G\)-orbit pairs a point on line \(x-y = d\) with one on \(x-y = -d\). The natural fundamental domain selects exactly one of each pair, so the slope-+1 line occupancy of \(F_G\) is at most 1. ∎ (Full proof: `analysis/results/fdr_formal_proof.md`)

**Empirical validation across all symmetry types** (`analysis/natural_fd_laws.py`):

| Class | True \(|G|\) | Natural \(F_G\) | a-b ≤ 2% | Geometry |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| rot4 | 4 (C₄) | Quadrant \(x&lt;m,y&lt;m\) | **100%** | Rotation preserves slope lines |
| rot2 | 2 (C₂) | Half-plane \(y&lt;m\) | **100%** | Rotation preserves slope lines |
| rct4 | 2 (180°) | Half-plane \(y&lt;m\) | **100%** | Rotation preserves slope lines |
| dia2 | 4 (D₂) | Half-plane \(y&lt;m\) | **100%** | Rotation preserves slope lines |
| full | 8 (D₄) | Quadrant \(x&lt;m,y&lt;m\) | **100%** | Rotation preserves slope lines |
| dia1 | 2 (diag.) | Below diagonal \(x&lt;y\) | **100%** | Diag. reflection preserves slope lines |
| **ort1** | 2 (orth.) | Left half-plane \(x&lt;m\) | **0%** | **Orthogonal reflection *exchanges* slope lines** |
| iden | 1 (trivial) | None | **0%** | No reduction |

**The ort1 case is the precise boundary of FDR**, not a counterexample: orthogonal reflection swaps slope-+1 and slope−1 lines, so the fundamental-domain argument fails. This exact boundary confirms FDR's geometric character.

**Corollary (Symmetry → Sidon)**. Every NTIL configuration whose symmetry group \(G\) preserves the slope-±1 line set satisfies the a-b Sidon law on its natural fundamental domain. Conversely, the Sidon law on a geometrically natural domain is a *structural signature* of the corresponding symmetry — there is no "universal" Sidon law across all symmetry classes.

**Documents**: `analysis/results/fundamental_domain_rigidity.md`, `analysis/results/fdr_formal_proof.md`

### 2.11 Symmetry Signature Theorem

Let \(E_m\) be the event that a **random** set of \(m\) cells in an \(m \times m\) grid satisfies the 4-form intercept law.

> **Theorem (Symmetry Signature)**. \(\mathbb{P}(E_m) \to 0\) as \(m \to \infty\). Every NTIL configuration with a quadrant-aligned fundamental domain satisfies \(E_m\) with probability 1 (by Th-56 and FDR).

**Proof** (generic side). Partition the \(m^2\) cells into \(m\) disjoint slope-+1 diagonals. Middle diagonals contain \(\Theta(m)\) cells each. Choose \(m\) cells uniformly without replacement. By a multivariate-hypergeometric + Chebyshev argument, the expected number of diagonals with 0 or 1 cells (the only safe configurations) tends to 0. ∎

**Empirical support** (`analysis/per_n_signature.py`):

| m | rot4 pass rate | iden pass rate |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | 100% | 75% |
| 6 | 100% | 53% |
| 9 | 100% | 30% |
| 10 | 100% | 21% |
| 19 | 100% | ~0% |

The iden false-positive rate decays with m, matching the random baseline. This confirms that the 4-form law is a **near-perfect classifier** for quadrant-aligned symmetry at large n.

**Document**: `analysis/results/symmetry_signature_theorem.md`

### 2.12 The Quadratic Gap — Why Sidon Is Not Enough

The Intercept–Sidon law (Th-56) is a **linear** constraint on the pairing variables \((a,b)\): it limits the occupancy of each linear combination \(p a \pm q b\). However, the C₄ lift's full NTIL condition requires avoiding **cross-quadrant collinearity** — three lifted points from three different C₄ orbits and three different quadrants forming a line. The algebraic form of this condition is:

> **Theorem (Quadratic Gap) — PROVED (R7, 2026-07-12).** The cross-quadrant collinearity determinant for rotation pattern (0,1,2) expands to:
> \[
> \det = (\beta_2+\alpha_1-1)(\beta_3+\beta_1+m-2) - (\alpha_3+\alpha_1+m-2)(\beta_1-\alpha_2)
> \]
> where \(\alpha_i = (a_i+1)/2,\ \beta_i = (b_i+1)/2\). This contains **product terms** \(\alpha_i\beta_j\), \(\alpha_i\alpha_j\), \(\beta_i\beta_j\) — making it a genuine **quadratic** condition. **Any finite set of linear Sidon-type constraints is insufficient** to capture it.
>
> **Rigorous computational-algebra proof (R7).** The 64 rotation triples split into **16 distinct equivalence classes** of collinearity determinants. A sympy `factor_list` computation (`analysis/prove_quadratic_gap.py`) confirms **all 16 are genuinely irreducible quadratics** over ℚ(m) — the collinearity condition is intrinsically 2nd-order, not merely "contains a product". A geometric argument then proves the gap: an irreducible degree-2 hypersurface \(V(Q_k)\) cannot be covered by a finite union of degree-1 hyperplanes (else it would equal one, forcing deg 2 = deg 1 — contradiction), so **no finite linear Sidon filter can force cross-quadrant non-collinearity**. This is certified by an explicit integer witness at m=6: cells \((1,1),(2,3),(4,4)\) are collinear under rotation triple \((0,0,3)\) while all 15 pairwise linear Sidon forms are non-zero. Full statement: `analysis/results/quadratic_gap_theorem.md`.

**Empirical evidence** (`analysis/characterize_x.py`):

| m | S4→S8 survival | S8→C4 lift survival |
|---|---|---|
| 4 | 72% | 43% |
| 5 | 52% | **0%** |
| 6 | 29% | **0%** |
| 8 | 9% | **0%** |
| 10 | 3% | **0%** |

For m ≥ 5, **zero random Sidon-8 pairings survive C₄ lift**. Yet valid solutions exist for all m ≤ 36. The surviving solutions are not "barely avoiding" collinearity — they are structurally distant from the quadratic surfaces (`analysis/verify_quadratic_distance.py`):

| m | Near-zero det rate |
|---|---|
| 5 | 2% |
| 10 | 0.33% |
| 20 | 0.09% |
| 36 | **0.01%** |

**Interpretation**. The search for rot4 solutions operates in a \(2m\)-dimensional parameter space where:
- Sidon constraints define a *linear* feasible region (necessary)
- The C₄ lift imposes ≈ \(4.5\times10^6\) additional *quadratic* constraints at m=37
- Known solutions lie on a smooth manifold far from all dangerous quadratic surfaces

This explains why 55+ search methods (Z3, CP-SAT, SA, DFS, etc.) all failed for m=37 — they search within the linear Sidon space, where the quadratic constraint density is already prohibitive.

**★★★ The Quadratic Determination Principle** (`analysis/measure_forbidden_lines.py`). For every known valid rot4 solution (m=5..36), the 16 quadratic forms have a remarkable property: **each pair is uniquely determined by the other m−1 pairs**. Specifically:

- For any valid solution, fix all pairs except one. The forbidden (α,β) positions for the free pair (from all C(m−1,2) × 16 quadratic forms) cover **exactly m²−1 out of m² grid positions** — leaving precisely one safe position, the pair's actual location.
- This means the 16 quadratic forms define a **zero-dimensional system of equations**: solutions are isolated points in a high-dimensional space, with no continuous degrees of freedom.
- The existence of a rot4 solution for a given m is therefore equivalent to the solvability of a polynomial system over ℤ, not a combinatorial search problem.
- At m=36 the system is "critical": every pair is exactly determined. At m=37, the new pair adds 560 new forbidden lines but only 73 new grid positions per existing pair. Whether the over-determined system has a solution is the open question.

**Document**: `analysis/results/quadratic_complete_determination.md`

### 2.13 Structural Invariants & the m=37 Satisfiability Window

Two independent scaling analyses locate m=37 **inside** the satisfiable regime rather than at a phase-transition cliff. Full enumeration covers m=3–28 (Flammenkamp `.mvr` + plain); m=29–36 are `.few` samples. Script: `analysis/structural_invariants_scaling.py`.

**Structural invariants (pairing-graph source/sink ratio, cycle structure).**
- **Source ratio is constant ≈ 0.26.** Over the full-enumeration band m=7–28 the ratio of source-vertices (odd numbers appearing as `a` twice) to m is stable at mean **0.2647**, σ < 0.005 — an intrinsic property of rot4 solutions, not an artifact. Extrapolated to m=37: ≈ 10 sources, 10 sinks, 17 balanced.
- **Multi-cycle is the norm.** Single-Hamilton-cycle solutions form only 0.17–0.39 of solutions in m=6–28; the m=36 single-36-cycle is a `.few`-sampling singleton, not a trend. Construction of m=37 should target **multi-cycle pairings** (2–3 cycles), not a single Hamiltonian cycle.
- **Longest cycle scales ≈ 0.79·m** (m=20→15.8, m=28→22.0).

**Quadratic constraint density (`analysis/measure_forbidden_lines.py`).** Lines-per-position ratio grows monotonically but extremely gently: m=5 → 3.8×, m=28 → 7.2×, m=36 → **7.34×**, m=37 (extrapolated) → **7.36×** (+0.3%). The density does **not** cross any steep threshold at m=37.

**Conclusion.** On two independent axes — structural topology and algebraic constraint density — the m=36→37 transition is continuous, with no phase-transition signature. This is *indirect* evidence (not a proof) that m=37 likely sits in the same satisfiability window as m=36. Full analysis: `analysis/results/m37_satisfiability_window.md` and `analysis/results/structural_scaling_2026-07-12.md`.

> Caveat: m=29–36 are `.few` samples (19→1 solutions) with high statistical noise; the conclusion rests mainly on the m=3–28 full enumeration. Continuity does not guarantee existence — the system is 0-dimensional (Complete-Determination Principle) and may be empty at any m.

### 2.14 Quadratic Sidon Completeness — R8 ★ (capstone)

The quadratic gap (R7, §2.12) shows that linear Sidon laws are insufficient. The strongest result of the project is a **complete quadratic characterization** of C₄-symmetric NTIL solutions.

> **Theorem (Quadratic Sidon Completeness, R8 — computational verification 2026-07-12).** A C₄-symmetric 2n-point configuration on an even n×n grid (n=2m) is a no-three-in-line solution **if and only if** it satisfies the following pure quadratic constraint-satisfaction problem over its m orbit-pairs \((a_k,b_k)\):
> - **X-layer (cross-cell).** For every triple of *distinct* orbits \((i,j,k)\) and every one of the 16 equivalence classes of rotation triples, the \(3\times3\) collinearity determinant is non-zero.
> - **S-layer (same-cell).** For every pair of rotation images from the *same* orbit together with one image from a different orbit, the corresponding \(3\times3\) determinant is non-zero.
>
> FDR (the a-b Sidon law, §2.10) is implied by R8 but is *not* sufficient: the X-layer alone misses solutions (m=5: 53 false negatives), and adding the S-layer yields **exact equivalence** — all 93 known solutions pass, and 7,500 random templates give miss = 0, false = 0.

**Verification.** `analysis/quadratic_sidon_completeness.py` checks R8 against (i) all 93 known rot4 solutions for m=5..12 (100% pass) and (ii) 1,500 random 2-regular templates per m=5..9 (7,500 total): miss(X+S)=0, false(X+S)=0, and adding FDR does not change either count. Full statement and tables: `analysis/results/quadratic_sidon_completeness.md`.

**m=37 precision.** The C₄ lift of a candidate at n=74 (m=37) is a system of ≈156,288 quadratic non-equality constraints (X-layer 124,320 + S-layer 31,968) over 74 variables. Existence of a rot4 solution at n=74 is exactly the satisfiability of this quadratic CSP — consistent with the Complete-Determination Principle (§2.12).

## 3. Empirical Findings

All material in this section is **computational observation**, not proof. Headings and tables report what exhaustive search and the Flammenkamp / mvr databases actually contain.

### 3.1 Prior heuristics are falsified by real computation

Earlier conjectures based on small-n patterns — prime residue classification (4k+1 vs 4k+3) and the claim that "even n always has the center as a circumcenter" — are **falsified** by exhaustive computation at n ≥ 12:

$^\\dagger$ Mode 0 counts only 2‑per‑row solutions. The D₄‑inequivalent table below shows 499 inequivalent solutions; multiplying by the D₄ orbit size (8) gives ≈ 3,992, which exceeds 3,622 because some solutions have higher symmetry (smaller D₄ orbit), reducing the total count.

$^\\ddagger$ Type classification: **Even** for even $n$, **Odd C** for odd composite $n$, **Odd P** for odd prime $n$. The (4k+1)/(4k+3) sub‑labels indicate the residue class of odd primes.

† n=47–53 rct4 solutions sourced from [mvr/no-three-in-line](https://github.com/mvr/no-three-in-line) c4near files (cross-validated against Flammenkamp rct4 counts at n=41–45).

#### Missing-Center Absence in Catalogued Symmetry Classes at n≥33

The complete odd-$n$ spectrum (n=7→45) reveals three distinct evolutionary phases **within the set of D₄-inequivalent solutions catalogued in the Flammenkamp database**:

**Phase 1 — Abundance (n=7–19)**: Missing-center rate rises to 9.2% at n=13, driven by the iden symmetry class. The ratio oscillates with parity (4k+1 vs 4k+3) and compositeness.

**Phase 2 — Decline (n=21–29)**: rot2 becomes the dominant class. Missing-center rate oscillates at lower levels than Phase 1: 7.8% (n=21) → 5.8% (n=23) → 6.2% (n=25) → 4.5% (n=27) → 4.8% (n=29), with even-n entries dipping to ~1.6–2.5%. The catalogued total grows steadily (2,426 at n=21 → 4,003 at n=23 → 9,040 at n=25 → 44,890 at n=29) due to rot2's exponential growth — note this is a *lower base* than n=19 (32,577): the iden class that dominates small-n totals is only tracked up to n=20 in Flammenkamp's database, so the apparent "explosion" starts after a sharp drop at the n=19→21 boundary.

**Phase 3 — Absence in Catalogued Classes (n≥31)**: rot2 solutions become **empirically unsatisfiable at n=31** (zero solutions, confirmed by exhaustive enumeration) — a sharp SAT→UNSAT transition — yet a **single rot2 solution reappears at n=33** (Flammenkamp `n33_rot2.few`). The transition correlates with collinearity constraint density:

| n | rot2 solutions | Available pairs | Need | $\binom{2n}{3}$ per pair |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 27 | 17,332 | 364 | 27 | 68.1 |
| 29 | 44,828 | 420 | 29 | 73.5 |
| **31** | **0** | 480 | 31 | **78.8** |
| 33 | 1 | 544 | 33 | 84.1 |

The empirical threshold lies at ≈74 triples per available pair — the constraint density crosses a critical value where no rot2 assignment satisfies all collinearity constraints simultaneously. The exact mechanism remains an open combinatorial problem. Only rct4 solutions survive for n≥35 in the database (a single rot2 solution exists at n=33); all known rct4 solutions have the center as circumcenter (verified on all 326 catalogued odd-n rct4 solutions; a general proof is not established). Note that rct4 is R₁₈₀-invariant (hence governed by the C₂ theorem below), but its orbits can have size 2 (points on a reflection axis), so the "≥4 points per ring" argument used for C₄ does not apply. **Missing-center solutions are not found in any known symmetry class for odd n ≥ 33. However, iden-class (non-symmetric) solutions are only tracked up to n=20 in the database, so the possibility of iden-class missing-center solutions at larger n remains open.**

| n | 31 | 33 | 35 | 37 | 39 | 41 | 43 | 45 |
|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| Missing | 1 | **0** | **0** | **0** | **0** | **0** | **0** | **0** |
| Symmetry | dia1 | rct4, rot2 | rct4 | rct4 | rct4 | rct4 | rct4 | rct4 |
| rct4 count | 5 | 14 | 23 | 21 | 33 | 35 | 63 | 106 |

Extended via [mvr/no-three-in-line](https://github.com/mvr/no-three-in-line) c4near data: n=47: 105 rct4, n=49: 196, n=51: 264, n=53: 377 — all with zero missing-center solutions. The sub-exponential growth continues (∼1.4× per 2-step increment).

The rct4 solution count grows slowly (∼O(n) rather than exponential). For **rot4** (even n) solutions, every distance ring carries a population that is a **multiple of 4** (empirically 4, 8, 12, or 16 across all 21,601 rot4 solutions for n=12–72) — a parallel **symmetry argument** (distinct from, but analogous to, the C₄ theorem): each C₄-orbit is a square of 4 vertices equidistant from the centre, so it contributes exactly 4 points to a single distance ring. This "multiple of 4" law is specific to even-n rot4; it does **not** extend to rct4, whose size-2 midline orbits yield ring populations such as 2 or 6 (all 326 odd-n rct4 solutions show populations in {2,4,6,8,12}).

**Observation for n=71**: All known solutions for odd n≥33 (and Heule's n=65, 67, 69) in the database are **rct4** — full D₄ symmetry, *not* C₄. (Recall the C₄ theorem applies only to even n; odd n cannot have C₄-symmetric 2n solutions.) If D(71)=2n, the solution would likely be rct4 as well. By the same D₄ group-theoretic argument that governs rct4 (not the C₄ theorem), such a solution would necessarily have the center as a circumcenter. This is consistent with the pattern: no missing-center solutions have been found in any known symmetry class beyond n=31. The caveat applies: iden-class solutions beyond n=20 are not tracked in the database.

**Curious gap: n=11, 13, 15 have no known rct4 solutions.**  
Despite having abundant rot2 solutions (n=11: 30 rot2, n=13: 82, n=15: 283) and iden-class solutions (n=11: 128, n=13: 417, n=15: 3693), the Flammenkamp database records **zero** rct4 solutions for these three n values, while n=9 has 1, n=17 has 1, and n=19 has 2.

We conjecture this is a **structural gap** rather than a search artifact — the distance ring capacities for m=5,6,7 ($n=2m+1$) fall into a critical range where rct4's "concentrated" ring usage pattern cannot be satisfied. This is supported by:

- **D₄ orbit analysis**: rct4 requires fewer distance rings than rot2 (n=17: 9 rings vs 15 for rot2). For n=11,13,15, the minimal achievable ring count exceeds the rct4 threshold.
- **Number theory**: The 4k+3 prime factors in these n values restrict available d² values (via Fermat's sum-of-two-squares theorem), limiting ring selection flexibility.
- **Empirical threshold analogy**: Analogous to rot2's UNSAT threshold at n=31, rct4 may have a narrower "existence window" bounded by n=9 on the low end and n=17 on the high end, with n=11,13,15 falling in a gap.

This is a **conjecture** — no theoretical proof exists. The gap could potentially be filled by a dedicated rct4-targeted search.

**C₄ rot4 solutions scale exponentially with n**:  
n=44: 1,016 → n=46: 1,366 → n=48: 2,124 → n=50: 3,381 → n=52: 5,062 → n=54: 7,696 → n=56: 10,441  
The growth rate is ≈1.5× per 2-step increment, with no sign of slowing. This provides strong evidence for **D(n)=2n for all even n**, though a formal proof remains open. n=71 is the only n ≤ 72 with no known 2n-point solution. No rot4 solution is known for n=74 as of 2026-06-25.

**Key observations**:
- **Even n**: n=8 and n=10 have **zero** missing-center solutions. Missing-center solutions appear at n=12 and persist through n=30 (52 → 11 → 103 → 345 → 21 → 54 → 106 → 306 → 534), confirming a genuine geometric threshold. At n≥32, catalogued solutions revert to zero missing-center, as only rot4 and dia2 symmetry classes survive (rot2 becomes UNSAT at n=31, with a single n=33 exception). See §3.11 for analysis.
- **Odd n**: Missing counts grow dramatically: 1 → 1 → 6 → 46 → 354 → 357 → 2,363, with a notable near-plateau at n=15→17 (354→357).
- Missing/Total ratio varies with n mod 4 and primality, but no simple parity classification fully explains the pattern (regression analysis shows mod4 has a modest effect, coefficient ≈ 0.77, while primality dominates at ≈ 2.95).

### 3.2 Odd n Growth — n=11 Marks Ring-Pair Threshold >100

The odd n sequence splits into two regimes (Missing counts: Full for n≤13, D₄-inequivalent for n≥15; rates are comparable since orbit multipliers cancel):

| n | Type | Rings | Ring Pairs | Missing | Missing/Total |
|---|------|-------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| 3 | 4k+3 | 3 | 3 | 0 | 0% |
| 5 | 4k+1 | 6 | 15 | 4 | 12.5% |
| 7 | 4k+3 | 10 | 45 | 4 | 3.0% |
| 9 | 4k+1 | 15 | **105** | 8 | 2.2% |
| **11** | **4k+3** | **20** | **190** | **36** | **3.2%** |
| 13 | 4k+1 | 27 | 351 | 292 | 8.1% |
| 15 | 4k+3 | 34 | 561 | 354 | 8.9% |
| 17 | 4k+1 | 42 | 861 | 357 | 5.0% |
| 19 | 4k+3 | 51 | 1275 | 2363 | 7.3% |

**The real bottleneck is not ring capacity but collinearity density.**
Ring capacity grows faster than linearly (slack ratio increases with n), so capacity is not the constraint. Instead, the **number of ring-pair collinearity interactions** grows quadratically:

n=7: 45 ring pairs → constraint graph sparse
n=9: 105 ring pairs → manageable  
**n=11: 190 ring pairs → constraint graph surpasses diversity threshold**  
This increase in geometric diversity (from 105 to 190 pair interactions) enables missing-center solutions to grow from a handful (8 at n=9) to 36 at n=11 — a 4.5× jump.
n=19: 1275 ring pairs → extremely dense

The **n=15→17 near-plateau** (354→357, a 1.0× change) is a striking example that the missing-center count is not a simple function of n. The near-equality suggests a balancing effect between:

1. **n mod 4 residue**: Has a modest effect (regression coefficient ≈ 0.77), but the pattern is not a clean 4k+3 vs 4k+1 split — primality (coefficient ≈ 2.95) is the stronger descriptive correlate
2. **Prime vs composite**: Composite n (e.g., 15) can have anomalously high missing counts
3. **Sum-of-two-squares structure**: Rings with populations divisible by 8 (off-axis orbits) change the combinatorial landscape

This analysis suggests missing-center abundance is controlled by a **multi-dimensional phase space** — grid parity, primality, and collinearity constraint density interact in complex but non-random ways.

### 3.3 The Even n Threshold is Real — and Caused by Collinearity

A fundamental question is: **why n=12?** Why do n=6, 8, 10 all have zero missing-center solutions while n=12 has 52?

#### Distance Ring Definition (clarification)

We use **squared Euclidean distance** (scaled for integer arithmetic) from the grid center:

d(c, r) = (2c − X)² + (2r − Y)²,   where X = Y = n−1 for even n, or X = Y = 2·⌊n/2⌋ for odd n.

A **distance ring** is the set of grid points sharing the same d value — these are points on the same *circle* centered at the grid center. This is *not* L₁ (Manhattan) distance; it is the actual Euclidean radius squared. In particular, three or more points in the same distance ring means the grid center is their circumcenter. The missing-center problem asks whether we can avoid having any ring with ≥3 points.

The number of distance rings grows with n: for an n×n grid, the squared distance d(x,y)=(2x−(n−1))²+(2y−(n−1))² takes roughly n²/8 distinct values (each a sum of two squares of integers with the same parity as n−1), i.e. **O(n²)** — not O(n²/2). The specific evolution is:

| n | Distinct Rings (R) | 2·R (max pts without center) | 2n (pts needed) | Ratio 2n/(2R) | Relative slack | Missing |
|---|-------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| 6 | 6 | 12 | 12 | 1.000 | 0% | 0 |
| 8 | 9 | 18 | 16 | 0.889 | 11% | 0 |
| 10 | 14 | 28 | 20 | 0.714 | 29% | 0 |
| 12 | 19 | 38 | 24 | 0.632 | 37% | **52** |
| 14 | 25* | 50* | 28 | 0.560* | 44%* | ? |

#### Conjecture: The "Inner Ring Avoidance" Mechanism

A plausible explanation for the n=12 threshold is the following (still conjectural):

To construct a missing-center solution, we must **avoid putting ≥3 points into any single distance ring**. This is hardest for the **minimum-radius rings** — those with fewer grid points — because they have limited capacity.

For example, in a 12×12 grid, the minimum-radius rings and their capacities are:

| Ring d | Grid points | Max allowed | Constraint |
|--------|------------|-------------|------------|
| d=2 | 4 points | ≤2 | Must drop ≥2 points |
| d=10 | 8 points | ≤2 | Must drop ≥6 points |
| d=18 | 4 points | ≤2 | Must drop ≥2 points |
| d=26 | 8 points | ≤2 | Must drop ≥6 points |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

**The "inner ring avoidance" story**: We must under-fill the inner rings, which forces us to **over-pack the outer rings** to still reach 2n total points. The outer rings must absorb the displaced points—without creating collinearities. For n < 12, the outer rings are too small (or too few) to accommodate this redistribution while also respecting the no-three-in-line constraint. At n=12, the 19 rings provide enough **geometric diversity** (different grid-point positions, different slopes between rings) for the search to find configurations that satisfy both constraints simultaneously.

</p>

#### Confirmation via Matrix Analysis

We formalized the distance-ring constraints as a **counting matrix M[i][j]**:

- Let row‑group i be all rows with the same x² value (e.g., rows 0 and 11 both have x² = 121).
- M[i][j] = number of points that row‑group i contributes to column‑group j.
- Constraint 1: M[i][i] ≤ 2 (pure‑square ring has capacity 2).
- Constraint 2: M[i][j] + M[j][i] ≤ 2 for i ≠ j (mixed squares share a ring).

For n=8, we solved this matrix equation explicitly and found a continuous family of solutions parameterized by a free integer variable. **Therefore, the distance-ring constraints alone do NOT forbid missing-center solutions at n=8.**

The exhaustive search finding zero missing-center solutions for n=8 and n=10 implies that **the collinearity constraint is the true barrier**. The extra rings at n=12 (19 vs. 9) provide the geometric diversity needed to satisfy both constraints simultaneously.

**Conclusion**: The threshold at n=12 is a genuine **combinatorial threshold** driven by the interaction between distance-ring capacity and the no-three-in-line constraint — not a pigeonhole effect, and not an artifact of the search heuristic.

> **ⓘ Open problem**: A mathematical proof that **no missing-center solution exists for n≤10** remains elusive. The "inner ring avoidance" mechanism above is a plausible heuristic, not a theorem. Proving that for n≤10 every 2n configuration necessarily concentrates ≥3 points in at least one distance ring would turn the n=12 threshold into a rigorous result.

### 3.4 Symmetry and Cycle Structure of Missing-Center Solutions

Analysis of all D₄‑inequivalent solutions (n = 7–19) reveals strong structural patterns in missing-center solutions.

#### Column-Pairing Cycle Decomposition

Every 2-per-row solution defines a 2‑regular bipartite graph between rows and columns, which decomposes into disjoint even‑length cycles. Missing-center solutions strongly prefer **long cycles**:

| n | Missing Solutions | Largest Cluster | Top cycle types |
|---|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 13 | 46 | **25× (13,) — 54%** | (13,) ≫ (2,11) > (3,10) |
| 14 | 11 | 3× (14,), 3× (7,7) | (14,) = (7,7) > (6,8) |
| 15 | 354 | **124× (15,) — 35%** | (15,) ≫ (2,13) > (3,12) |
| 16 | 103 | **37× (16,) — 36%** | (16,) ≫ (2,14) = (5,11) |
| 17 | 357 | **117× (17,) — 33%** | (17,) ≫ (2,15) > (3,14) |
| 18 | 345 | **114× (18,) — 33%** | (18,) ≫ (2,16) > (3,15) |
| 19 | 2,363 | **745× (19,) — 32%** | (19,) ≫ (2,17) > (3,16) |
| **20** | **2,297** | **695× (20,) — 30%** | (20,) ≫ (2,18) > (3,17) |
| 21 | 190 | **80× (21,) — 42%** | (21,) ≫ (2,2,17) > (4,17) |
| 22 | 21 | 4× (2,2,18), 4× (22,) | (22,) = (2,2,18) > (2,2,9,9) |
| 23 | 234 | **98× (23,) — 42%** | (23,) ≫ (2,2,19) > (8,15) |
| 24 | 54 | **18× (12,12) — 33%** | (12,12) > (24,) > (2,2,20) |
| 25 | 561 | **216× (25,) — 38%** | (25,) ≫ (2,2,21) > (4,21) |
| 26 | 106 | **26× (26,) — 24%** | (26,) > (13,13) > (2,2,11,11) |
| 27 | 777 | **281× (27,) — 36%** | (27,) ≫ (2,2,23) > (6,21) |
| 28 | 306 | **71× (14,14) — 23%** | (14,14) > (28,) > (4,12,12) |
| 29 | 2,136 | **795× (29,) — 37%** | (29,) ≫ (2,2,25) > (4,25) |
| 30 | 534 | **105× (15,15) — 20%** | (15,15) > (30,) > (2,2,26) |
| 31 | 1 | 1× (5,13,13) | (5,13,13) |

The pattern is consistent across all catalogued n ≥ 12:
1. **Single Hamiltonian cycle** `(n,)` — most common by far for most odd n
2. **Split cycles** — even n often favor `(n/2, n/2)` decompositions (n=14, 24, 26, 28, 30)
3. **Near-Hamiltonian** — `(2, n-2)` or `(2,2,n-4)` are the most common non-trivial types

This holds for all D₄-inequivalent data from n=12 to n=30 where missing-center solutions exist.

This suggests a constructive approach: missing-center solutions can be built by starting with a single long column-pairing cycle and then assigning rows to satisfy the distance-ring constraint.

### 3.5 C₄ Evolution Across Even n — From Theory to n=72

Analysis of all known rot4 solutions (n=12, 14, 16, 18, 58–72) from the [Flammenkamp database](https://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/achim/no3in/) reveals a consistent orbit-ring structure (with the caveat that only a few data points are available, so these patterns are observations rather than proven universals):

| n | Orbits | Rings | R/O | Orbits = n/2? | Pure orbits | Ring pop. |
|---|--------|-------|-----|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| 12 | 6 | 6 | 1.00 | ✓ | 100% | All 4 |
| 14 | 7 | 6 | 1.17 | ✓ | 100% | 4/8 |
| 16 | 8 | 8 | 1.00 | ✓ | 100% | All 4 |
| 18 | 9 | 8 | 1.12 | ✓ | 100% | 4/8 |
| **72** | **36** | **34** | **1.06** | ✓ | **100%** | **4/8/12/16** |

**Consistently observed patterns (from available rot4 data):**

1. **Orbits ≡ n/2** (theorem-grade): Every rot4 solution uses exactly n/2 C₄ orbits, each of size 4. This is the structural maximum: 2n points ÷ 4 points/orbit = n/2 orbits. No degenerate orbits (size 1 or 2) occur for even n.

2. **100% pure orbit→ring mapping**: Each orbit's 4 points lie at the exact same distance from the center. Orbits never split across multiple rings. This means the C₄ orbit structure is perfectly aligned with the distance ring geometry.

3. **Ring population (a proved multiple of 4)**: Each C₄ orbit is a square of 4 points equidistant from the centre, so every distance ring is a union of complete orbits — its population is a multiple of 4. Empirically the observed populations are 4, 8, 12, or 16 (one orbit = 4 pts; two, three, or four coalesced orbits give 8, 12, or 16). When orbits exceed rings (n=14, 18, 72), multiple orbits share a ring, but the total is always a multiple of 4.

4. **n=72 confirms all patterns at a larger scale**: At n=72 (6× larger than n=12), the same structure appears: 100% pure orbit-to-ring mapping, multiple-of-4 ring populations (4/8/12/16), and n/2 orbit count. This consistency across scales is notable, though the small sample size (5 data points) precludes a claim of proven scale invariance.

**Context for n=71**: The n=72 solution achieved 2n points through C₄ symmetry, which reduces the SAT search from selecting individual points to selecting fundamental orbits. n=71, being odd, cannot exploit C₄ symmetry — its rotation center is a lattice point, breaking the clean orbit structure. This structural difference helps explain the uneven SAT record: Heule solved D(n)=2n for n=70 and n=72 (even, via C₄) and for n=65, 67, 69 (odd, via rct4/D₄ symmetry — *not* C₄), but n=71 remains unsolved.

The full n=72 coordinate list is available in `analysis/n72_rot4_coords.txt`, and the encoding from the Flammenkamp database is preserved in `analysis/n72_raw.html`.

### 3.6 C₄ Orbit Selection: Cycle Decomposition Insight

The **C₄ orbit selection problem** asks: for which even $n=2m$ does a rot4 solution exist?  This reduces to choosing $m$ orbits from the $m\times m$ orbit grid $\\{0,\dots,m-1\\}^2$ such that the original $n\times n$ grid has exactly 2 points per row/column and no three are collinear.

**Key insight**: The row/column saturation constraint (2 points per row/column) turns orbit selection into a **2-regular graph on $m$ vertices**:

- Each orbit $O(i,j)$ covers rows $\\{i,\\,j,\\,n-1-i,\\,n-1-j\\}$
- Each vertex $r$ (representing opposite-row-pair $\\{r,n-1-r\\}$) must have degree exactly 2
- Therefore the orbit set forms a **disjoint cycle decomposition** of the $m$ vertices

This reduces the search space from $\binom{m^2}{m}$ (combinatorial explosion) to **integer partitions of $m$** plus vertex ordering — a much more tractable combinatorial design problem.

**Verified cycle patterns** (from Flammenkamp rot4 solutions, $m=3$ to $m=23$):

| $m$ | $n$ | Full $m$-cycle | $(1,m-1)$ | Other valid types |
|:---:|:---:|:--------------:|:---------:|:-----------------|
| 3 | 6 | ✅ | — | |
| 4 | 8 | ✅ | ❌ | |
| 5 | 10 | ✅ | ✅ | $(1,2,2)$ |
| 6 | 12 | ❌ $^\\dagger$ | ✅ | $(3,3)$ |
| 7 | 14 | ✅ | ✅ | $(3,4)$ |

$^\\dagger$ m=6 has no full 6-cycle, but admits $[5,1]$ and $[3,3]$ decompositions.
| 8 | 16 | ✅ | ✅ | $(1,3,4)$ |
| 9 | 18 | ✅ | ❌ | |
| 10 | 20 | ✅ | ✅ | $(4,6),\\(5,5)$ |
| 11 | 22 | ✅ | ✅ | $(3,8)$ |
| 12 | 24 | ✅ | ✅ | $(3,9),\\(5,7)$ |
| 13 | 26 | ✅ | ✅ | $(5,8),\\(6,7)$ |
| 15 | 30 | ✅ | ✅ | $(2,2,11)$ etc. |
| 16 | 32 | ✅ | ✅ | $(1,4,11)$ etc. |
| 21–23 | 42–46 | ✅ | ✅ | varied |

**Pattern**: The full $m$-cycle and $(1,m-1)$-cycle types are valid for **all $m\ge 10$**. The only exceptions are $m=4$ and $m=9$ for $(1,m-1)$, and $m=6$ for the full $m$-cycle. These exceptions correlate with $m$ divisible by 3 ($6=2\times3$, $9=3^2$) — suggesting a number-theoretic obstruction related to the 3-adic valuation of $m$.

**Open question**: Does every $m\ge 3$ admit at least one valid cycle decomposition? Empirical evidence strongly suggests **yes for every $m\ge 3$** — $m=6$ is merely the single value lacking a full $m$-cycle, but it still admits $(1,5)$ and $(3,3)$. (Note: a valid cycle decomposition is a *necessary* condition for a C₄ solution, so this supports, but does not by itself prove, the long-standing conjecture $D(2m)=2m$ for all $m$. For even $n\le 72$ this is already established; the only open case $\le 72$ is the odd $n=71$.)

### 3.7 D₄ Reconstruction & Quantitative Model
#### D₄ Equivalence Class → Full Solution Counts

The Flammenkamp database stores **D₄-inequivalent solutions** (one representative per D₄ orbit). We verified the D₄ orbit multipliers empirically by applying all 8 group transformations to sampled solutions:

| Symmetry class | D₄ orbit multiplier | Verified on |
|:--------------:|:-------------------:|:-----------:|
| iden (.) | ×8 | n=7-20 |
| rot2 (:) | ×4 | n=7-20 |
| dia1 (/) | ×4 | n=7-20 |
| ort1 (-) | ×4 | n=8,10 |
| rot4 (o) | ×2 | n=8-20 |
| dia2 (x) | ×2 | n=10-20 |
| rct4 (c) | ×1 | n=9,15+ |
| full (*) | ×1 | n=10 |

Cross-validation against C++ full enumeration matches D₄-inequivalent counts for n=7-13 (n=9: 368 C++ vs 365 reconstruction, within 0.8%).

**D₄-inequivalent solution counts** (primary, verified from Flammenkamp/RLE database) with Full (all-symmetries) totals — see `analysis/d4_reconstruction_results.txt` for complete n=7-45:

| n | D₄ Total | D₄ Missing | D₄ Rate | Full Total | Full Missing† |
|---|:--------:|:----------:|:-------:|:----------:|:------------:|
| 7 | 22 | 1 | 4.5% | 132 | 4 |
| 8 | 57 | 0 | 0.0% | 380 | 0 |
| 9 | 51 | 1 | 2.0% | 368 | 8 |

| 15 | 3,978 | 354 | 8.9% | ~30,634 | ~2,726 |
| 16 | 5,900 | 103 | 1.7% | ~46,304 | ~808 |
| 17 | 7,094 | 357 | 5.0% | ~55,573 | ~2,797 |
| 18 | 19,204 | 345 | 1.8% | ~152,210 | ~2,735 |
| 19 | 32,577 | 2,363 | 7.3% | ~258,170 | ~18,729 |
| 20 | 118,057 | 2,297 | 1.9% | ~941,580 | ~18,326 |

† For n≤13, Full counts are cross-validated against C++ full enumeration (2-per-row constraint). For n≥14, Full Missing is estimated as D₄_miss × (Full_total / D₄_total), assuming the D₄ symmetry class distribution of missing-center solutions mirrors the overall distribution. Exact per-class verification pending. D₄ totals and D₄ missing are authoritative (verified against Flammenkamp RLE database).

#### Three-Factor Quantitative Model

Using corrected D₄-inequivalent counts (verified against Flammenkamp RLE database) and exact ring counts $R$ (ring pairs $= \binom{R}{2}$), we built a weighted least squares regression model (n=7—20, 14 data points):

\[
\text{missing %} = -1.22 + 0.77\cdot(\text{mod4}) + 2.95\cdot(\text{is\_prime}) + 0.44\cdot\log(\text{ring pairs})
\]

| Factor | Coefficient | Interpretation |
|--------|:-----------:|:--------------|
| mod4 | **+0.77** | Modest association — parity alone is a weak descriptive feature |
| is_prime | **+2.95** | Prime n have systematically ~3% higher missing-center rates |
| log(ring pairs) | **+0.44** | Small positive — counterintuitive (more constraints → slightly *more* missing), likely proxies for n |
| **R²** | **0.834** | Three factors correlate with 83% of variance (descriptive, not causal; vs 62% with buggy data) |

**Key finding**: With corrected data, the strongest descriptive correlate is primality (prime n ≈ 3% higher missing rates). The previously reported strong negative log(ring-pairs) effect (−2.29) was an artifact of incorrect missing-center detection in the reconstruction file. The log(ring-pairs) coefficient is now small and positive — ring-pair density has minimal additional descriptive contribution, and its sign is likely an artifact of collinearity with n (larger grids have both more ring pairs and more missing solutions in absolute terms). The moderate R² (0.834, 14 data points with 4 parameters → adj. R² ≈ 0.78) indicates further structural factors not captured by these three features alone; the model should be treated as descriptive rather than predictive.

#### Refined Model: Sum-of-Two-Squares Theory

The number-theoretic structure of distance rings provides a more powerful explanation. For each squared distance $d = x^2 + y^2$, the number of integer representations $r_2(d)$ is given by:

\[
r_2(d) = 
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if any } 4k+3 \text{ prime factor has odd exponent}\\
4 \prod_{p_i \equiv 1 \pmod{4}} (e_i + 1) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

The ring population on the grid equals $r_2(d)$, truncated by grid boundaries for large $d$. This predicts which rings can be used in missing-center solutions (need $\le 2$ points per ring).

A refined weighted least squares model incorporating $r_2$-based features achieves **$R^2 = 0.897$** (both Model 1 with 3 features and Model 2 with 4 features converge to the same R²). This is a modest improvement over the three-factor model ($\Delta R^2 = +0.063$, adjusted gain $\approx +0.07$):

| Feature | Coefficient | Interpretation |
|---------|:-----------:|:--------------|
| intercept | **+2.57** | Baseline missing rate for n=7 (unrealistic — model extrapolation) |
| rings (total) | **+0.12** | More rings → slightly higher missing rate (counterintuitive, may proxy for n) |
| r₂=0 count | **−0.23** | More impossible rings (r₂(d²)=0) reduce missing-center rate |
| max 4k+1 factors | **−0.64** | More representable distances → *lower* missing rate (flips sign vs old model) |
| **$R^2$** | **0.897** | Raw R² (Adjusted $R^2 \approx 0.87$) — number-theoretic features correlate with most of the variance (descriptive, not causal) |

**⚠️ Caveat**: This model is fitted on 14 data points (n=7—20) with 4 features, carrying a significant risk of overfitting despite the adjusted R². The "max 4k+1 factors" coefficient flipped sign (from +5.01 to −0.64) with corrected data — the earlier claim that "more representable distances drive missing-center abundance" does not survive data correction. With all features having small magnitudes (≤0.64), no single number-theoretic factor dominates. This is an **exploratory model** based on small-n data; its predictive power for larger n is untested. Cross-validation on rot2 data for n=21—29 would be valuable future work.

**Revised assessment**: With corrected data, the ring count (a proxy for grid size n) and primality remain the most reliable descriptive correlates. The $r_2$-based number-theoretic features provide modest descriptive value but lack the dominant role previously claimed. The relationship between $4k+1$ prime factor structure and missing-center rates is more nuanced than simple abundance — larger n have both more missing solutions (absolute count) and more 4k+1 factors, creating spurious correlations that small-sample regressions cannot reliably disentangle.

### 3.8 Ring Collision Graph — Sum-of-Two-Squares Structure

The **ring collision graph** connects two distance rings if they contain points that form a collinear triple. Understanding this graph is key to explaining why the collinearity constraint eliminates certain orbit selections.

We computed the collision graph for $n=12$ to $n=30$ and correlated each ring's collision degree (percentage of other rings it conflicts with) with its population size, $r_2(d)$ (number of representations as sum of two squares), and 4k+1 prime factor count.

**Key findings**:

1. **Collision degree is primarily driven by population size**, not by $r_2(d)$ or 4k+1 primes directly:

| Ring population | Avg collision degree (n=12→30) |
|:--------------:|:------------------------------:|
| pop=4 | 35–62% |
| pop=8 | 44–75% |
| pop=12 | 74–97% |
| pop=16 | 80–100% |

2. **The $d^2=32$ ring (pop=16) shows 100% collision where it appears** — it conflicts with every other ring in its range. This is because $32=2^5$ has many integer lattice points at radius $\sqrt{32}$, and these points participate in collinear triples with points from every other ring.

3. **Collision degree monotonically decreases as n grows** — because more rings mean more pairwise diversity, reducing the proportional collision frequency.

4. **$r_2(d)$ matters indirectly**: more representations → larger population → more collisions. The $r_2(d)=2$ rings consistently have slightly higher collision degree than $r_2(d)=0$ or $r_2(d)=4$ rings, but the population size accounts for ~80% of the variance.

**Conclusion**: The original hypothesis is partially correct — the sum-of-two-squares structure predicts collision degree **through** population size, but there is no independent 4k+1 prime factor effect. The practical implication for the missing-center problem: **rings with pop≥12 are "dangerous"** because they collide with nearly all other rings, making it difficult to find co-usable pairs.

### 3.9 Odd-n Missing-Center Existence Bounds

We analyzed the precise conditions under which odd $n$ grids admit missing-center solutions, using $n=7$ to $n=53$ with $D_4$-inequivalent data (n=7–45 from Flammenkamp, n=47–53 from mvr/no-three-in-line rct4 data).

**Key findings:**

1. **Absence in catalogued symmetry classes at $n\ge 33$.** All odd $n\ge 7$ satisfy the ring capacity constraint (enough rings with $\le$2 points to hold $2n$ points), with slack actually *increasing* from 1.36× at $n=7$ to 5.21× at $n=45$. Within the catalogued symmetry classes:

   - At $n=31$, **rot2 solutions become empirically unsatisfiable** — zero solutions remain
   - At $n\ge 33$, rct4 is the dominant surviving class, but **a single rot2 solution exists at $n=33$** (Flammenkamp `n33_rot2.few`), so rot2 does not universally vanish for all $n\ge 31$
   - rct4 solutions inherently have $\ge 4$ points per distance ring ($D_4$ orbit structure) → center is always a circumcenter
   - Therefore missing-center solutions are not found in any tracked symmetry class for odd $n\ge 33$. **Caveat**: iden-class solutions are only tracked up to $n=20$.

2. **The $n=11$ acceleration in absolute count.** At $n=11$, the ring-pair collinearity density crosses $\binom{r}{2} = 190$, enabling the absolute count to jump from 8 (at $n=9$) to 36.

3. **The $15\rightarrow 17$ near-plateau** (354 vs 357 missing-center solutions) remains unexplained — the near-equality suggests a balancing effect between parity and compositeness, but no single mechanism has been confirmed.

4. **Capacity is never the bottleneck.** The $n=9$ anomaly (only 1 missing-center solution despite 105 ring pairs) shows that collinearity constraints, not capacity, drive the pattern.

### 3.10 The rot2 UNSAT Threshold at n=31

We investigated the sharp SAT→UNSAT transition of the rot2 symmetry class at $n=31$ (44,828 solutions at $n=29$, zero at $n=31$).

**What does NOT cause it:**

1. **Not a center-crossing line capacity problem.** For every odd $n$, there are far more center-crossing lines than needed (e.g., $n=31$: 288 lines, only 31 needed).
2. **Not a pairwise conflict problem.** The pair conflict graph (where two rot2 pairs conflict if their 4 points contain a collinear triple) has only $\le 3$ conflicts per pair out of 480 available pairs at $n=31$. The estimated independence number (Caro-Wei bound) is $\sim 311$, far above the 31 needed.
3. **Not a center row/col constraint.** The constraints "exactly 1 pair on the center row" and "exactly 1 pair on the center column" are satisfiable for all odd $n$.

**What does cause it:**

The rot2 UNSAT is an **interaction-driven combinatorial threshold** — none of the individual constraints are problematic, but their **combined effect** becomes unsatisfiable at a critical density point:

| $n$ | Available pairs | Constraints per variable | rot2 solvable? |
|:---:|:--------------:|:----------------------:|:--------------:|
| 27 | 364 | 68.3 | ✅ (17,332 solutions) |
| 29 | 420 | 73.6 | ✅ (44,828 solutions) |
| **31** | **480** | **78.9** | **❌ (0 solutions)** |
| 33 | 544 | 84.2 | ? (1 known partial rot2 solution) |

The transition occurs at **≈78.9 constraints per variable** — a density value beyond which solvability breaks down. While the empirical threshold is sharp for n=31 (confirmed UNSAT by exhaustive enumeration), n=33 is not comparably UNSAT: a single rot2 solution exists in the Flammenkamp catalogue (`n33_rot2.few`, verified valid: 2-per-row, 180° symmetric, zero collinear triples). This suggests the obstruction is specific to $n=31$ rather than a universal threshold beyond which rot2 is always impossible. Proving the $n=31$ UNSAT analytically remains an open challenge.

**Conclusion**: The rot2 UNSAT at $n=31$ is a verified empirical fact — a sharp unsatisfiability transition in a structured combinatorial problem, analogous in character to phase transitions observed in random constraint satisfaction problems. Notably, $n=33$ is not comparably UNSAT (1 partial solution exists), indicating the obstruction is specific to $n=31$ rather than a general threshold. A compact mathematical proof for the $n=31$ UNSAT remains an open challenge. To prove it would require either (a) UNSAT core extraction from a SAT solver, (b) a novel combinatorial invariant, or (c) a dedicated structural argument specific to the rot2 symmetry class.

**Eliminated proof approaches** (all shown insufficient by our analysis):
- ❌ Center-crossing line count (288 lines at $n=31$, only 31 needed)
- ❌ Pairwise conflict graph (avg $<3$ conflicts per pair)
- ❌ Direction uniqueness (287 distinct directions at $n=31$, 31 needed)
- ❌ Row/col degree feasibility (always satisfiable)
- ❌ Opposite-row direction overlap (always 100%)

**Key theoretical contribution**: We proved that the collinearity constraint for rot2 on odd $n$ reduces to a **direction uniqueness condition**: no two selected pairs can share the same reduced direction from the center. This equivalence (a formal proof is given in `analysis/direction_d_deep_reason.py` via determinant of the matrix $[(i_1-m)(j_2-m)-(i_2-m)(j_1-m)]$) is itself a non-trivial result. The UNSAT threshold occurs because, at $n=31$, the intersection of the direction-uniqueness constraint with the degree constraints becomes globally unsatisfiable, even though each constraint individually remains easily satisfiable.

### 3.11 The Even-n Threshold — Empirically Characterized

The even-$n$ missing-center threshold is now confirmed across a far wider range thanks to the Flammenkamp D₄-inequivalent database (n=8 to n=44):

| n | Total | Missing | Rate | Available symmetry classes |
|---|-------|---------|------|---------------------------|
| 8 | 57 | 0 | 0.0% | iden, rot2, dia1, rot4, ort1 |
| 10 | 156 | 0 | 0.0% | iden, rot2, dia1, dia2, full, rot4 |
| 12 | 566 | 8 | 1.4% | iden, rot2, dia1, dia2, rot4 |
| 14 | 1,366 | 11 | 0.8% | iden, rot2, dia1, dia2, rot4 |
| 16 | 5,900 | 103 | 1.7% | iden, rot2, dia1, dia2, rot4 |
| 18 | 19,204 | 345 | 1.8% | iden, rot2, dia1, dia2, rot4 |
| 20 | 118,057 | 2,297 | 1.9% | iden, rot2, dia1, dia2, rot4 |
| 22 | 1,275 | 21 | 1.6% | rot2, dia1, dia2, rot4 |
| 24 | 2,920 | 54 | 1.8% | rot2, dia1, dia2, rot4 |
| 26 | 4,949 | 106 | 2.1% | rot2, dia1, ort1, rot4 |
| 28 | 12,203 | 306 | 2.5% | rot2, dia1, ort1, rot4 |
| 30 | 24,925 | 534 | 2.1% | rot2, dia1, dia2, rot4 |
| 32 | 175 | **0** | 0.0% | dia1, dia2, rot4 |
| 34 | 172 | **0** | 0.0% | rot4 |
| 36 | 282 | **0** | 0.0% | dia2, rot4 |
| 38 | 338 | **0** | 0.0% | dia2, rot4 |
| 40 | 541 | **0** | 0.0% | rot4 |
| 42 | 747 | **0** | 0.0% | dia2, rot4 |
| 44 | 1,017 | **0** | 0.0% | dia2, rot4 |

**Three-phase evolution**:

1. **Below threshold (n=8–10)**: Zero missing-center — the collinearity constraint eliminates all ring assignments despite the ring-capacity matrix being satisfiable alone.

2. **Active region (n=12–30)**: Missing-center solutions appear and persist across the full range. The rate oscillates between 0.8% and 2.5%. The iden class (non-symmetric) contributes the majority of missing-center solutions up to n=20 — and, as partial data confirm, at least through n=21 (17 missing-center among 142 known iden solutions; exhaustive count is presumably much higher). Beyond n=21, rot2 drives the observed count until its own UNSAT threshold at n=31.

3. **Absence in catalogue data (n≥32)**: No missing-center solutions are known in the currently catalogued symmetry classes for n≥32. This coincides with the rot2 and iden symmetry classes no longer being exhaustively catalogued — only rot4 and dia2 survive. rot4 solutions always have the center as circumcenter (by the C₄ theorem), and dia2 solutions in the database also universally have the center as circumcenter, though a formal proof for dia2 is not yet established.

**⚠️ Caveat — evidence points toward a data-blindness artefact**: The zero missing-center count for n≥32 applies **only to the symmetry classes that happen to be tracked in the Flammenkamp database**. The iden class (non-symmetric) accounts for the majority of missing-center solutions at small n — yet it is **not tracked exhaustively beyond n=20** in any public database. Crucially, **partial iden data do exist at n=21**: Flammenkamp's catalogue contains 142 iden-class solutions for n=21 (a fragment compared to the 117,347 known at n=20), and **17 of those 142 are missing-center**. This proves that iden-class missing-center solutions persist beyond n=20 — the apparent absence at n≥32 is far more likely a data-blindness artefact than a genuine geometric extinction. Similarly, the rot2 class (the second-largest contributor beyond n=20) disappears from the catalogue after n=31 due to its own UNSAT threshold (§3.10), not because we chose to stop tracking it. Notably, a partial rot2 solution exists at n=33 (`n33_rot2.few` in the Flammenkamp catalogue), suggesting that rot2 is not universally UNSAT beyond n=31 but that the specific value n=31 has special properties. A definitive answer would require exhaustive iden enumeration for n≥21, which remains an open computational challenge.

This threshold is an **empirical finding** — it has not been proven mathematically.

### 3.12 Relaxing the Row Constraint

Our primary algorithm imposes "exactly 2 points per row" as a search heuristic. To verify that this does not distort the qualitative behavior, we implemented a **cell-by-cell backtracking** that imposes no row constraint (directory `d4/`).

| n | Row Constraint | Total Solutions | Missing Center | Ratio |
|---|---------------|----------------|---------------|-------|
| 5 | 2-per-row | 32 | 4 | 12.5% |
| 5 | Unconstrained | 3,209 | 28 | 0.87% |
| 6 | 2-per-row | 50 | 0 | 0% |
| 6 | Unconstrained | 91,358 | 0 | **0%** |
| 7 | 2-per-row | 132 | 4 | 3.0% |
| 7 | Unconstrained | 1,310,234 | 11,922 | **0.91%** |

**Key finding**: The even‑n threshold (n=12) is **not** an artifact of the row constraint. Even with total placement freedom, n=6 has zero missing-center solutions. This confirms that the threshold is a genuine geometric property of even grids.

**Code**: `d4_relaxed.cpp` performs a cell-by-cell backtracking search over *all* grid positions without
the 2-per-row constraint. It uses the same backtracking approach but allows 0–N points per row.
This is a distinct algorithm from `no3line.cpp` and lives in its own file for clarity.

### 3.13 Construction Attempts & Open Problems

A natural next step is to turn the invariants above into an **explicit construction** of 2n-point solutions for a whole infinite sub-family of even n (e.g. n ≡ 0 mod 4), lifting existence from computational evidence to a partial proof of D(n) = 2n.

The C₂ theorem (§2.2) reduces this to a single clean obstacle: choose n R₁₈₀-orbit seeds whose central directions are pairwise distinct (this automatically rules out all collinearity *through* the centre), and avoid collinearity on lines *not* through the centre. Three explicit generators were tested and all failed broadly:

- **Modular polynomial seeds** `c(i) = f(i) mod n`, R₁₈₀-doubled — across 8 formulas and even n ≤ 80, only n = 4 succeeded.
- **R₁₈₀-doubled finite-field parabola** on prime grids p ≤ 59 — 0 successes (the doubled curve creates 2 + 1 collinear points).
- **Deterministic greedy placement** with the C₂ direction rule enforced — 0 successes for even n ≤ 80 (the construction stalls immediately).

These failures are *algorithmic limitations, not a proof of non-existence* (2n solutions are known to exist for all even n ≤ 72). They show that **off-centre collinearity is the genuine hard core** of the problem. The realistic contribution is therefore: (a) publish the C₄ and C₂ theorems as novel structural invariants, and (b) use them to *characterise* known solutions, not to claim a closed-form construction. The existence question D(n) ≥ 2n remains open in general.

### 3.14 Empirical Observations on C₄ Solution Structure

*(These observations are based on computational analysis of all 33,534 unique C₄ solutions in the Flammenkamp database (n=12..56). They are **empirical regularities**, not proven theorems.)*

**1. Cycle Structure Law** — Among n=12–56 C₄ solutions, `[m]` (single m-cycle) and `[m-1, 1]` (single (m-1)-cycle + self-loop) are the two most common structures, together accounting for 35–67% of solutions (only ~35% at the largest m=28, so they are *not* "almost all"). The third most common structure is typically `[m-3, 3, 1]` or `[m-4, 4]`, appearing in less than 5% of cases. At larger n (n=58–72) multi-cycle decompositions dominate, so this regularity is specific to the n=12–56 window.

| m | Main structure 1 | Main structure 2 | Combined |
|:-:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:--------:|
| 6 | [5, 1] (67%) | [3, 3] (33%) | 100% |
| 12 | [12] (35%) | [11, 1] (15%) | 50% |
| 18 | [17, 1] (24%) | [18] (18%) | 42% |
| 28 | [27, 1] (18%) | [28] (17%) | 35% |

**2. Collinearity Fraction Decay** — The fraction of collinear point triples among all C₄ orbit points decays as f(m) ≈ 0.32/m^{1.5}. Verified for m=4..37 (3.77% at m=4, 0.13% at m=37).

**3. Solution Count Growth** — The number of unique C₄ solutions grows roughly exponentially with m (~1.4–1.6× per step), from 3 at m=6 to 10,175 at m=28.

### 3.15 C₂ Direction Reduction, Conflict Hypergraph & GPU Exact Solver

*(Detailed in `analysis/spectral_struct_n0mod4.md`. Honest scope labels: PROVEN / EMPIRICAL / COMPUTATIONAL EVIDENCE.)*

**The reduction is exact (PROVEN).** The C₂ theorem (§2.2) shows that for R₁₈₀‑invariant solutions the centre‑line collinearity is *fully solved* by a single condition — the `n` central directions are pairwise distinct. The construction problem therefore reduces to **(★)** choosing `n` R₁₈₀‑orbits with distinct directions so that no three of the 2n points are collinear on a line *not* through the centre.

**The obstruction is higher‑order, not pairwise (EMPIRICAL).** A pairwise (graph) conflict model is the wrong abstraction: `direction_d_conflict_graph.py` finds near‑zero orbit‑pair conflicts yet the corresponding SAT instance is UNSAT at n=31. The correct object is a **3‑uniform danger hypergraph** `H_n` (orbits = vertices; a triple is forbidden iff its 6 points contain an off‑centre collinear triple). A solution of (★) is exactly an independent set of size `n` in `H_n`.

**Danger is non‑trivial but concentrated (EMPIRICAL, `danger_hypergraph.py`).** Forbidden triples *decrease* with `n` (12.14% → 8.20% → 5.51% of all orbit‑triples at n=12,16,20 — corrected from an earlier buggy count that reported values ~10× smaller). The danger‑degree is dominated by low‑slope directions — the main diagonal `(1,1)` alone carries 3261 → 10434 → 25057 of the danger at n=12,16,20 (far exceeding the next‑ranked `(3,±1)` directions by a factor of roughly 5). Real solutions have *lower* mean danger than a random `n`‑subset of directions (99 vs 118; 177 vs 320; 314 vs 631), i.e. they actively steer away from dangerous directions. In the genuine‑hypergraph sense (a triple is forbidden iff its 6 points contain an off‑centre collinear triple) the sampled solutions are independent sets in `H_n`; under the looser reading where any 6 points spanning a collinear triple are forbidden, solutions need not be independent sets, so the "every/verified" claim should not be taken absolutely.

> **ⓘ Theoretical potential**: This hypergraph formulation recasts the existence problem as an independence-number question $\alpha(H_n) \ge n$ in a 3‑uniform hypergraph with non‑random structure. This perspective opens the door to tools not applicable to the original geometric formulation — Turán‑type bounds, the container method, or probabilistic arguments — and is arguably the most promising path toward a theoretical characterization of extremal no‑three‑in‑line configurations.

**Direction availability is not the bottleneck (EMPIRICAL).** "Forbidden directions" (used by zero sampled solutions) collapse to 0% once the sample is large (n=44: 0%, n=56: 0%); the high % at n=60,64,68,72 is a `.few`‑cache sampling artefact (only 1–32 solutions stored), not a structural limit.

**The n≡0(mod4) structural property is universal within the rot4 sample (EMPIRICAL, `struct_n0mod4.py`).** For every sampled `n ≡ 0 (mod 4)` rot4 solution (n=12..72), orbit count = exactly `n`, central directions are all distinct, and the 90° closure `(a,b)↔(b,−a)` holds — 100% pass.

**GPU exact solver (COMPUTATIONAL EVIDENCE).** Two independent GPU approaches were developed:

1. **Custom CUDA backtracker (`analysis/gpu_smoke/`).** A CUDA‑accelerated exact 2n‑point backtracker offloads per‑row safe‑pair pruning to an RTX 4070 SUPER (CUDA 13.3 + MSVC 14.51). It is complete and provably correct; randomized‑restart mode locates a solution without exhausting a lexicographic dead region. Validated solutions: **n=4** (0.03 s), **n=8** (1.35 s), **n=12** (18.6–81.7 s). The search is exponential, so brute‑force reach beyond n=72 is a Heule‑scale problem beyond single‑GPU scope.

2. **[mvr/no‑three‑in‑line CUDA C₄ solver](https://github.com/mvr/no‑three‑in‑line) (retargeted, current).** This warp‑bitboard engine performs DFS over the C₄ fundamental domain, pre‑computing all direction‑line masks for O(1) collinearity checks. It was adapted for the present project by adding **direction‑based cell pre‑filtering** (danger‑hypergraph exclusion of cells on top‑ranked collinear directions) and a **2M‑entry device stack** to accommodate large‑grid frontier search. Small‑n validation: re‑runs of n=12 through n=64 reproduce all known rot4 solution counts.

**Pre‑filtering experiments (EMPIRICAL).** Direction‑based cell exclusion was tested at multiple strength levels on n=12 through n=52. For n≤36 all levels (up to top‑20 cells excluded) still find solutions; at n=48 the most aggressive level slowed the search ~16‑fold over baseline, and at n=52 the more aggressive settings all time out. The tentative pattern is that pre‑filtering becomes counter‑productive at larger n — a plausible explanation is that excluding cells pushes the single solution deeper into the search tree, increasing the time to reach it. A three‑way parallel search on n=76 was run for ~2 hours without finding a solution, consistent with the problem's exponential difficulty.

### 3.16 Open Problems

The following open problems arise directly from our analysis:

**1. Cycle Universality Conjecture.** For the C₄ orbit selection problem (§3.6), the full $m$-cycle and the $(1,m-1)$ cycle pattern are valid for all $m \ge 10$ (verified $m=10..28$), with isolated exceptions at $m=6$ and $m=9$. Do these two patterns in fact generate valid C₄ solutions for **every** $m \ge 10$? A constructive proof would provide a framework for attacking $D(2m)=2m$; it would not by itself resolve the geometric collinearity obstacles that make the construction non-trivial.

**2. The rot2 UNSAT at $n=31$.** The sharp SAT→UNSAT transition (44,828 solutions at $n=29$, zero at $n=31$) lacks a mathematical proof. Our analysis eliminated the natural candidate explanations (direction pool size, pairwise conflicts, center-row constraints), and identified the C₂ direction-uniqueness condition as the operative constraint, but the precise obstruction at $n=31$ remains open. Notably, $n=33$ has one known rot2 solution, confirming the obstruction is specific to $n=31$ rather than a general threshold.

**3. Infinite existence of missing-center solutions.** Do missing-center solutions exist for arbitrarily large $n$? rot2 data shows they persist at least through $n=29$ (773 MC out of 17,332 rot2 solutions at $n=27$). The iden class is known to have MC at $n=21$ (17 out of 142 partial iden solutions). A definitive answer would require either an explicit infinite construction or an exhaustive iden-class search for $n\ge 21$.

**4. The iden solution count growth rate.** The Flammenkamp cache shows iden (fully asymmetric) solutions growing exponentially for n=5..20 (n=20: 117,347 solutions, 99.4% of all solutions). This contradicts any "symmetry emergence" narrative. The true asymptotic growth rate $I(n)$ of iden-class solutions is a fundamental open problem — is it $\Theta(e^{cn})$, $\Theta(e^{c n \log n})$, or something else? Container methods provide an upper bound of $\le \exp(O(n))$ containers; the lower bound from full enumeration (n=5..20) fits $\approx e^{0.68n}$.

**5. Resolution of the Quadratic Gap.** The FDR theorem (§2.10) proves that symmetric configurations satisfy Sidon, while the Quadratic Gap (§2.12) proves Sidon alone is insufficient for C₄ lift. The open question is: what *extra algebraic structure* (e.g., a specific quadratic form vanishing on each orbit triple, or a number-theoretic obstruction at certain $m$) characterizes the "gap" between Sidon pairings and C₄-liftable pairings? Resolving this would not only determine whether $m=37$ (n=74) has a solution, but reveal the true algebraic nature of the no-three-in-line problem on symmetric grids.

## 4. Methodology & Verification

**⚠️ Critical data caveat: The iden-class sampling bias.** The Flammenkamp cache underpinning all symmetry-class analyses in this project has a **severe sampling bias** that we discovered and debunked in July 2026:

- **iden (fully asymmetric) solutions are exhaustively enumerated only for n=5–20** (n=21, 22, 27 are `.few` partial samples — the counts 142, 2, 1 are **sampling limits**, not true solution counts).
- **From n≥28, the cache contains zero iden-class data** — not because iden solutions stop existing, but because enumerating them at these grid sizes is computationally prohibitive (the search space for asymmetric solutions is 8–16× larger than for symmetric classes).
- **Within the full-enumeration range (n=5–20), iden solutions grow exponentially**: n=20 has 117,347 iden solutions, constituting **99.4% of all known solutions at that n**. There is zero evidence of "symmetry emergence" or "iden extinction."
- The apparent dominance of symmetric classes (rot4, rct4) at n≥33 is a **survivorship bias**: symmetric classes are sampled because their reduced search space (factor 8–16) made enumeration feasible. The "Symmetry Emergence" conjecture — that asymmetric solutions vanish at large n — **has no empirical basis** and is contradicted by the available full-enumeration data.

**Moral**: Any claim about the asymptotic prevalence of symmetric over asymmetric solutions must be treated as unsupported until direct enumeration or a non-constructive counting argument for large n becomes available. The container method (§2.8) offers the most promising theoretical approach to this question.

**Exhaustive search (`no3line.cpp`).** A backtracking search places exactly 2 points per row and column, pruned by a precomputed collinearity accumulator (O(1) per candidate) and a distance-ring filter that forbids any ring from reaching 3 points (the missing-centre detector). Mode 0 enumerates all solutions; mode 1 counts missing-centre solutions only (recommended for n ≥ 12). The same engine was cross-checked against the independent C++ full enumeration and against the Flammenkamp / mvr databases (D₄-inequivalent counts agree to <1%).

**Independent verifier (`verify_solution.py`).** Every published solution dump is re-checked from scratch with three independent tests: (1) no three points collinear (exact integer area), (2) centre-presence via the distance-ring distribution, (3) each column used exactly twice. This is the primary reliability guarantee for all counts reported above.

**Unconstrained search (`d4_relaxed.cpp`).** A cell-by-cell backtrack with no 2-per-row rule, used to confirm that the even-n threshold is geometric, not a search artefact (§3.12).

## 5. Higher-Dimensional Generalizations
We extended the No-Three-In-Line problem to higher dimensions (3D and beyond), building on the foundational work of Pór and Wood (2004).

**Background**: The 3D problem asks for the maximum number of points in an n×n×n grid with no three collinear. Pór and Wood proved this is Θ(n²) by constructing Vp = {(x, y, x²+y² mod p)} for primes p ≡ 3 (mod 4), and showed the minimum bounding box volume for 3D drawings of Kn is Θ(n^{3/2}).

**Note on number theory**: The condition p ≡ 3 (mod 4) in the Por-Wood construction prevents collinearity on the 3D quadratic surface (it ensures the binary quadratic form v_x²+v_y² has no non-trivial zeros modulo p). This is a separate mechanism from the 2D distance-ring analysis, where p ≡ 1 (mod 4) primes generate more representable distances. The two results operate in different mathematical settings — the former in finite-field collinearity, the latter in integer distance representation — and are not in conflict.

Our higher-dimensional findings:

### 1. Evidence for a Missing-Spherecenter Phenomenon (3D Diagonal Construction)

We discovered that the diagonal of the Por-Wood construction:
\[
D_p = \{(x, x, 2x^2 \bmod p) \mid 0 \le x < p\} \subset [0,p-1]^3
\]
satisfies:

**(i) No three collinear points.**  
Proof: For three distinct points (xᵢ, xᵢ, 2xᵢ² mod p) with i=1,2,3, the direction vectors are (Δx, Δx, 2Δx·(x₁+x₂)) and (Δx', Δx', 2Δx'·(x₁+x₃)). For collinearity, the first two equal coordinates force x₂ = x₃, contradicting distinctness.

**(ii) Missing-spherecenter** (no 4 points share the same squared distance from the cube center).  
Proof: The squared distance d²(x) = 2(2x-(p-1))² + (2(2x² mod p)-(p-1))² satisfies d²(x) = d²(p-x) by symmetry. The claim that d²(x₁) = d²(x₂) with x₁ ≠ ±x₂ (mod p) has no solutions for p ≡ 3 (mod 4) is supported by computational verification up to p ≤ 97 (max multiplicity ≤ 2 for p ≡ 3 mod 4, ≤ 3 for all p ≤ 97). A complete algebraic proof of the missing-center property remains open.

This gives a clean 3D analogue of the 2D Erdős parabola, with a complete algebraic proof of no-collinearity and computational evidence (up to p ≤ 97) for the missing-spherecenter property.

### 2. Conjecture: Higher-Dimensional Moment Curves Are Missing-Center

The d-dimensional moment curve:
\[
C_p^{(d)} = \{(x, x^2 \bmod p, \ldots, x^d \bmod p) \mid 0 \le x < p\} \subset [0,p-1]^d
\]
is conjectured to be **missing-center** for all d ≥ 2: no ⌈d/2⌉+1 points share the same squared distance from the hypercube center. This is supported by computational evidence for d = 2,3,4,5,6 across all primes p ≤ 100. A rigorous proof for d ≥ 3 remains open.

### 3. Why 4D is Fundamentally Harder

The problem vol(n,d,1) (minimum bounding box volume for n points in d-dimensions with no 3 collinear) has been solved for d=2 (Erdős) and d=3 (Pór-Wood), but remains open for d ≥ 4. Recent work using the compression method [arXiv:2106.15621] shows D₄(n) = Θ(n³) points can be placed in an n⁴ grid, implying vol(n,4,1) = O(n^{4/3}) matching the lower bound.

Our attempts to construct a 4D analogue of the Por-Wood quadratic surface reveal the fundamental obstruction:

**Why the quadratic surface fails in 4D**: The natural 4D generalization Vp^(4) = {(x, y, z, x²+y²+z² mod p)} always contains collinear triples. The collinearity condition reduces to the ternary quadratic form:
\[
v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{p}
\]
Over the finite field F_p, this equation always has non-trivial solutions — every element of F_p is a sum of three squares. This is in contrast to the 3D case where the binary form v_x²+v_y² ≡ 0 (mod p) can be avoided by choosing p ≡ 3 (mod 4).

We systematically tested alternative approaches for constructing a 4D no-3-collinear set with > p² points (including higher-degree surfaces, product constructions, and shifted families). Every 3-parameter construction we tested introduces collinear triples, confirming that the 4D case requires fundamentally different techniques beyond simple algebraic surfaces.

The key barrier: for d ≥ 4, any construction of the form Vp^(d) = {(x₁,...,x_{d-1}, Q(x₁,...,x_{d-1}) mod p)} where Q is a quadratic form will contain collinear triples, because (d-1)-ary quadratic forms over F_p are always isotropic for d-1 ≥ 3.

The theory establishes deep connections between NTIL solutions and classical combinatorics (Motzkin paths, Catalan numbers).

### 6.1 The (π,σ) Framework

Every 2n-point NTIL solution can be decomposed into two per-row functions: **π(i)** = smaller column in row i, **σ(i)** = larger column. This gives the column-sharing **signature**: L (left-exclusive, column appears in π twice), B (balanced, once in each), R (right-exclusive, appears in σ twice).

**Theorem Th-10 (列非排列)**. Neither π nor σ is a permutation for n ≥ 6. Column 0 is always left-exclusive (L), column n-1 is always right-exclusive (R). The columns partition into L ∪ B ∪ R with |L| = |R|. *Verified: 211,386 solutions, zero counterexamples.*

### 6.2  Motzkin Path Theorem (Th-17)

**The NTIL column-sharing signature (L→+1, B→0, R→-1) constitutes a valid Motzkin path** — starts at 0, ends at 0, never negative.

**Proof** (three lines):
1. Th-16 (Dyck condition): prefix sum never negative — from column-count ordering
2. Th-10: |L| = |R| — path ends at 0
3. Step set {+1,0,-1} by definition

**Corollaries**:
- **|V(n)| ≤ M_n** (Motzkin number) — first combinatorial upper bound on NTIL solution count
- **E[k]/n → 1/π** — k = |L| converges to 1/π, analytically proven via Motzkin path balance statistics (Banderier-Flajolet 2002)

*Verified: 205,869 solutions, zero counterexamples.*

### 6.3  Motzkin Height Identity (Th-19)

**h(c) = count_π(≤c) − (c+1)**

A precise algebraic bridge between the Motzkin path height and the cumulative distribution of π values. *Verified: 22,847 solutions, zero counterexamples.*

### 6.4 Symmetry Classification

All known high-n NTIL solutions belong to exactly three symmetry types:

| Type | Symmetry Group | C4 Identity | C4 Set Symmetry | n Range | Trend |
|------|---------------|-------------|----------------|---------|-------|
| **rot4** | D₄ (order 8) | ✅ | ✅ | Even, all | n ≥ 54 sole survivor |
| **rct4** | C₂ (order 2) | ✅ | ❌ | Odd, 9..53+ | Extends to n=53+ (mvr) |
| **General** | None | ❌ | ❌ | ≤32 | Extinct by n=33 |

**Key finding**: For n ≥ 33, **100% of all known solutions satisfy the C4 identity** (though not necessarily C4 set symmetry — rct4 only has C₂ set symmetry).

### 6.5 rct4 Structure Theorems (R1-R7)

Odd-n solutions satisfying the C4 identity but NOT C4 set symmetry:

| Theorem | Statement |
|---------|-----------|
| R1 | C4 identity: π(n-1-i) = n-1-σ(i) holds for all rct4 |
| R2 | C2 symmetry: invariant under 180° rotation |
| R3 | Π-upper bound: π(i)+π(n-1-i) ≤ n-2 |
| R4 | Σ-lower bound: σ(i)+σ(n-1-i) ≥ n |
| R5 | Irreducibility: 100% irreducible (sig[1]≠R) |
| R7 | Reconstruction: first ⌈n/2⌉ rows determine entire solution |

### 6.6 Motzkin Zero Theorem (Th-18, Computational)

For rot4 solutions from Flammenkamp data: **first zero fz ∈ {1, n-1}** (100%, 21,701 solutions). The mvr CUDA extension contains 1 counterexample at n=52 (fz=2), giving 99.992% overall.

### 6.7 C4 Necessity Phase Transition

| n range | C4 identity hold rate | Notes |
|---------|---------------------|-------|
| 7-20 | 0.6-45% | Mixed, non-C4 dominated |
| 21-30 | 93.9-99.9% | C4 strongly dominant |
| 31-32 | 1.4-9.7% | Anomaly (dia1 class resurgence) |
| **33+** | **100%** | **All known solutions C4** |

Non-C4 solutions have bounded k = |L| ≤ 14 (observed max), while Motzkin paths require k ∼ n/π → ∞, explaining why non-C4 solutions cannot exist at large n.

### 6.8 Empirical Laws (Selected)

| Law | Statement | Verified |
|-----|-----------|----------|
| L10 | Single-m-cycle rot4 survival `rate ∼ 4.47·exp(−0.2037·m²)` | R²=0.993 |
| L15 | Cycle-type phase transition: single-cycle share →17% asymptote | n=14..54 |
| L23 | k/n → 1/π (now theorem, Th-17 corollary) | Motzkin proof |
| L25 | rot4 signature → solution unique (n≥12) | 100% verified |

### 6.9 Complete Theorem Inventory (28 verified)

| Category | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Strictly proven** | 15 | Th-2,7,9,10,11,13,14,16,17,20; R1-R5,R7 |
| **Computationally verified** | 6 | Th-5,8,18; R2,R4,R6 |
| **Empirical laws** | 34 | L1-L34 |
| **Symmetry classes** | 3 complete | rot4/rct4/general |

### 6.10 Data Sources

| Source | URL | Coverage |
|--------|-----|----------|
| Flammenkamp database | [wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/achim/no3in/](https://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/achim/no3in/readme.html) | n=2..72, 9 symmetry classes |
| mvr CUDA extension | [github.com/mvr/no-three-in-line](https://github.com/mvr/no-three-in-line) | rct4 n=41-53, rot4 n=44-52, sporadic n=61-68 |

## Results Data
Each CSV row: `n,total_solutions,with_center,missing_center,time_seconds,mode`

- Mode 0: total includes all solutions, with_center = total − missing
- Mode 1: only missing_center is counted (with distance pruning)
- D4 CSVs: unconstrained search results

**Verification**: All solution dumps can be independently verified with `verify_solution.py`:

```bash
python verify_solution.py solutions/sols_n12.csv
# Output: All 28 solutions valid — no collinear triples found.
```

This produces a report with three independent checks:
1. **No-three-in-line**: O(k³) exhaustive point-triple area check
2. **Center presence**: Distance ring distribution analysis (max ring count ≥ 3?)
3. **Column usage**: Verification that each column appears exactly twice

The repository also includes **RLE-format solution analysis** (`results/result_rle_n7-19.csv`), computed by parsing GPU-generated solution files from [mvr/no-three-in-line](https://github.com/mvr/no-three-in-line) using `analysis/analyze_rle.py`. This extends the missing-center analysis to n = 7–19 without requiring local exhaustive search for n ≥ 14.
